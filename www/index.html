The road to success is always under construction; this little garden of a web page is too üë∑üèóÔ∏è

<h2>The 24601 (Who am I?)</h2>
Alexander Petros!
I'm a software engineer, writer, and artist living in New York City.
I'm originally from Miami, Florida.

<h2>What I've Got Going On</h2>
<p>
A little while ago I had some ideas about how to build durable web systems and I quit my job to
work on them. Here, I'll tell you what they are:

<details>

<summary>Alex's Crank Ideas About Web Services</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Many web services experience traffic loads that can be handled by a single server
  <li>Many web services have requirements that can be met with HTML and little to no JavaScript
  <li>Many people believe, incorrectly, that (1) or (2) does not apply to their web service
  <li>A web service that adheres to (1) and (2) is orders of magnitude cheaper to maintain than one
    which does not, and often provides a better user experience
</ol>
</details>

<p>
I have built a couple production, public-facing web services this way, all of which I maintain
entirely by myself (they just work).

<p>
I'm currently working on bringing more expressivity to HTML with
<a href="https://github.com/alexpetros/triptych">The Triptych Project</a>, the basic principles of
which I outlined in <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/life-and-death-of-htmx/">
"The Life & Death of htmx" talk at Big Sky Dev Con</a>.

<p>
I'm also working on an ActivityPub concept.

<h2>Career</h2>


<h4>Recurse Center, <span class=job-titles>Spring 2024 Retreat Member</span></h4>
<p>
I am doing a 3-month programming retreat at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=044d120abf1c334d0b2a3132634eb025">Recurse Center</a>!
It's a tremendous group of thoughtful, smart people all working on interesting projects.
I'm working on an open-source ActivityPub implementation that's really easy to self-host.

<h4>htmx, <span class=job-titles>Core Maintainer</span></h4>
<p>
Core maintainer and <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/">occasional blogger</a> for the <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> JavaScript Library.
The hypermedia concepts revitalized by htmx are going to reinvent web development for the next decade.
I do not get paid.

<h4>Freelance Software Consulting, <span class=job-titles>Self-employed</span></h4>
<p>
I build software infrastructure for non-software companies, with architectures that can last for years with very little maintenance.
You can hire me to do this for you too.

<h4>Dartmouth College, <span class=job-titles>Web Administrator</span></h4>
<p>
I rebuilt the Outdoor Programs registration stack from scratch (with htmx, to really test out its capabilities) and I now maintain it.
This was an unmitigated success, in that it is reliable, cheap, and runs with with virtually no maintenance.
I also help them out with other minor web projects related to the <a href="https://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/firstyear/">First Year Trips</a> program.

<h3>Past</h3>

<h4>The Washington Post, <span class=job-titles>Software Engineer ‚Üí Senior Software Engineer ‚Üí Engineering Lead</span></h4>
<p>
I was responsible for the software platform that powers The Post's freelancing operations, which I took over when it crashed.
I rebuilt the entire deployment stack and got the system to a stable state.
In my capacity as an Engineering Lead, I was in charge of both engineering direction and product management, working with multiple department stakeholders to coordinate and prioritize our very limited resources.
I managed one (1) person.

<h4>Amazon, <span class=job-titles>SDE Intern ‚Üí SDE I ‚Üí SDE II</span>.</h4>
<p>
I was on the Alexa Video Multimodal team, which was responsible for video playback on the Echo Show family of devices.
I worked on improving the service's performance under peak load, and designed partner-facing APIs.

<h4><strong>Stealth Startup</strong>, <span class=job-titles>Software Engineer</span></h4>
<p>
I quit after three months because I did not like it.
