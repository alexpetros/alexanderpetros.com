<h2>Career</h2>
<h3>Present</h3>

<p>
<strong>htmx</strong>, <em>Core Maintainer</em>
<br>
Core maintainer and occasional blogger for the htmx JavaScript Library.
At the risk of being melodramatic, I think this hypermedia concepts are going to reinvent web development for the next decade.
I do not get paid.

<p>
<strong>Freelance Software Consulting</strong>, <em>Self-employed</em>
<br>
I build software infrastructure for non-software companies, with architectures that can last for years with very little maintenance.
You can hire me to do this for you too.

<p>
<strong>Dartmouth College</strong>, <em>Web Administrator</em>
<br>
I rebuilt the Outdoor Programs registration stack from scratch (with htmx, to really test out its capabilities) and I now maintain it.
This was an unmitigated success, in that it is reliable, cheap, and runs with with virtually no maintenance.

<h3>Past</h3>

<p>
<strong>The Washington Post</strong>, <em>Software Engineer ‚Üí Senior Software Engineer ‚Üí Engineering Lead</em>
<br>
I was responsible for the software platform that powers The Post's
freelancing operations, which I took over when it crashed and subsequently
rebuilt the entire deployment stack. In my capacity an Engineering Lead for this project, I managed one (1) person.

<p>
<strong>Amazon</strong>, <em>SDE Intern ‚Üí SDE I ‚Üí SDE II</em>.
<br>
I was on the Alexa Video Multimodal team, which was responsible for video playback on the Echo Show family of devices.
I worked on improving the service's performance under peak load, and designed partner-facing APIs.

<p>
<strong>Stealth Startup</strong>, <em>Software Engineer</em>
<br>
I quit after three months because I did not like it.
