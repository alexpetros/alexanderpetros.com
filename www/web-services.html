<details>
<summary>Alex's Crank Ideas About Web Services</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Many web services experience traffic loads that can be handled by a single server
  <li>Many web services have requirements that can be met with HTML and little to no JavaScript
  <li>Many people believe, incorrectly, that (1) or (2) does not apply to their web service
  <li>A web service that adheres to (1) and (2) is orders of magnitude cheaper to maintain than one
    which does not, and often provides a better user experience
</ol>
</details>

<p>
I have built a couple production, public-facing web services this way, all of which I maintain
entirely by myself (they just work).
