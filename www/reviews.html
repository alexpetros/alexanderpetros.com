<h2><a href="https://wemakeinter.net/superfungibletoken">SFT</a></h2>

      >As with the Fountain, the SFT’s existence depends on how the people engage(d) with it. The
      artists chose to destroy the contract so that no one could purchase the piece; in some ways,
      it is a large-scale public artwork for the internet age. In making the work Kolman and Petros
      sought to make an artwork that trolls on the expectations of uniqueness and ownership that are
      associated with NFT art. If anyone can alter it, what is the work?</q>
