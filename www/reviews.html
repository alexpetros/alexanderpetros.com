<h1>Reviews of my work</h1>

<h2>Trailhead</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><q>Trailhead has already changed the DOC by connecting OPO staff, trip leaders and trippees — and as the platform continues to evolve, it will surely open up the outdoors more than ever for the Dartmouth community.</q></dt>
  <dd>Kalina Duncheva, <cite>The Dartmouth</cite></dd>

  <dt><q>We keep buying these 10 to 12 passenger vans, [when] the median number of people on a trip
      is six. We need[ed] an electronic system to help us track all this.</q>
  </dt>
  <dd>Rory Gawler, Assistant Director, Dartmouth Outdoor Programs</dd>

  <dt><q>One of the better Dartmouth websites, honestly</q></dt>
  <dd>Gwen, Dartmouth '25</dd>

<h2>Private Client Project</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><q>Much better than our previous system.</q></dt>
  <dd>Staff Member</dd>

  <dt><q>It seems like it's working fine.</q></dt>
  <dd>Executuve Director</dd>

<h2><a href="/">"The Life & Death of htmx"</a></h2>
<dl>

  <dt><q>The most-watched talk at Big Sky Dev Con.</q></dt>
  <dd>Carson Gross</dd>

  <dt><q>Excellent talk! Let's get a formal proposal made</q></dt>
  <dd>YouTube user @JordanShurmer</dd>

  <dt><q>Another win with HTMX is that it’s got absolutely nothing to do with adding 'AI' to all the things.</q> </dt>
  <dd>YouTube user @steveoc64</dd>

  <dt><q>this guy looks like a hotter george clooney</q></dt>

<h2>AYTA</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><q>The results are fascinating</q></dt>

<h2>SFT</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <q>As with the Fountain, the SFT’s existence depends on how the people engage(d) with it. The
      artists chose to destroy the contract so that no one could purchase the piece; in some ways,
      it is a large-scale public artwork for the internet age. In making the work Kolman and Petros
      sought to make an artwork that trolls on the expectations of uniqueness and ownership that are
      associated with NFT art. If anyone can alter it, what is the work?</q>
  </dt>
  <dd>Suzana Poghosyan, <cite>The Curator Mag</cite> (possibly defunct)</dd>

  <dt>
    <q>Did it just break or is someone committing to the bit with the two Weird Al images recurring over and over recently? (Image #740-760 range)</q>
  </dt>
