<h2>Career</h2>

<h3>Present</h3>

<h4>htmx, <span class=job-titles>Core Maintainer</span></h4>
<p>
Core maintainer and <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/">occasional blogger</a> for the <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> JavaScript Library.
The hypermedia concepts revitalized by htmx are going to reinvent web development for the next decade.
I do not get paid.

<h4>Freelance Software Consulting, <span class=job-titles>Self-employed</span></h4>
<p>
I build software infrastructure for non-software companies, with architectures that can last for years with very little maintenance.
You can hire me to do this for you too.

<h4>Dartmouth College, <span class=job-titles>Web Administrator</span></h4>
<p>
I rebuilt the Outdoor Programs registration stack from scratch (with htmx, to really test out its capabilities) and I now maintain it.
This was an unmitigated success, in that it is reliable, cheap, and runs with with virtually no maintenance.
I also help them out with other minor web projects related to the <a href="https://outdoors.dartmouth.edu/firstyear/">First Year Trips</a> program.

<h3>Past</h3>

<h4>Recurse Center, <span class=job-titles>Spring 2024 Retreat Member</span></h4>
<p>
I am doing a 3-month programming retreat at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=044d120abf1c334d0b2a3132634eb025">Recurse Center</a>!
It's a tremendous group of thoughtful, smart people all working on interesting projects.
I'm working on an open-source ActivityPub implementation that's really easy to self-host.


<h4>The Washington Post, <span class=job-titles>Software Engineer → Senior Software Engineer → Engineering Lead</span></h4>
<p>
I was responsible for the software platform that powers The Post's freelancing operations, which I took over when it crashed.
I rebuilt the entire deployment stack and got the system to a stable state.
In my capacity as an Engineering Lead, I was in charge of both engineering direction and product management, working with multiple department stakeholders to coordinate and prioritize our very limited resources.
I managed one (1) person.

<h4>Amazon, <span class=job-titles>SDE Intern → SDE I → SDE II</span>.</h4>
<p>
I was on the Alexa Video Multimodal team, which was responsible for video playback on the Echo Show family of devices.
I worked on improving the service's performance under peak load, and designed partner-facing APIs.

<h4><strong>Stealth Startup</strong>, <span class=job-titles>Software Engineer</span></h4>
<p>
I quit after three months because I did not like it.
