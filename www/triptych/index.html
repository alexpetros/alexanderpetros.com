<h1>Triptych Proposals</h1>

Three HTML Proposals to increase its expressive power as hypermedia:

<ol>
  <li>Forms should be able to make PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests
  <li>Buttons should be able to issue HTTP requests, independent of forms
  <li>Links, Buttons, and Forms should be able to target and replace a DOM subtree
</ol>

I first outlined these proposals in
<a
  href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/life-and-death-of-htmx/">The Life & Death of htmx</a>
at Big Sky Dev Con.

<p>I'm working on the proposals, and they'll be shared here soon.
