<h1>Triptych Proposals</h1>

Putting "hyper" back in the hypertext.

<h2>Proposals</h2>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/triptych/form-http-methods">Support PUT, PATCH, and DELETE in HTML Forms</a> (<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3577#issuecomment-2294931398">issue tracker</a>)
  <li>Button HTTP Requests
  <li>Partial Page Replacement
</ol>

<p>
The first proposal is out, the second two are still in progress.
In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://github.com/alexpetros/triptych">Triptych Polyfill (on GitHub)</a>.


<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
Triptych is three simple proposals that make HTML much more expressive in how it can make and handle network requests.

<p>
If you are a practical person, you could say it brings the best of <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> (and other attributed-based page replacement libraries, like <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">turbo</a> and <a href="https://unpoly.com/">unpoly</a>) to HTML. For the more theoretically-inclined, it <a href="/triptych/form-http-methods#completing-rest">completes</a> HTML's ability to do Representational State Transfer (REST) by making it a sufficient <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/">self-describing representation</a> for a much wider variety of problem spaces.

<p>
Basically, it should be easy to use HTML to declare page behavior that makes HTTP requests, and then tell the browser to either do a full-page navigation or replace part of the page with the response. Triptych enables this by bringing all the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">HTTP methods</a> to HTML, giving buttons to ability to make requests without the help of a form, and making it possible to target a DOM subtree for replacement with the response.

<h2>Is there a realistic chance any of this happens?</h2>
Yes! See the issue tracker above.

<h2>I ain't reading all that, is there a video?</h2>
<p>
I first outlined these proposals in <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/life-and-death-of-htmx/">The Life & Death of htmx</a> at Big Sky Dev Con.
