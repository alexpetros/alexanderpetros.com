Yes! Yes!!! I watched so many mediocre Mission Impossible movies to get here and this one rocks!!!!<p>The plane thing <em>opens</em> the movie. Rebecca Ferguson is instantly compelling. There's a killer scene at the opera (although I must here note that the cherished-by-me Final Fantasy VI opera sequence does this conceit slightly better by having one of the main characters be involved in the opera itself. Sorry, that reference is a bit much, even for this letterboxd page). The underwater stuff is sick. The silly plot feels sufficiently less silly because there's enough good actors committing to it. They brought back sand and motorcycles and Luther. <p>Got some flaws but who cares—this franchise finally found the right amount of nonsense.

A friend of mine gave a couple of us a tour of the Museum of the Moving Image's <em>Mission Impossible</em> exhibit in preparation for the new movie. In one of the little documentary shorts, Cruise says something to the effect of: "it took 3 movies before I formed a connection with the audience and understood what they wanted."<p>Even though I haven't seen the rest of the series yet, this is clearly the point where Cruise decided the audience wanted less Mission and more Impossible. This is the first movie with a landmark stunt, and the rest of it is largely an excuse to get you there as enjoyably as possible. It succeeds in this very achievable mission.<p>Brad Bird does a fine job, but I was hoping for a little more—most of his ideas get flattened by the franchise requirements. There's a clear theme about the fallibility of gadgets that has aged pretty well, although it happens precisely one too many times, necessitating a regrettably self-aware joke about it. Bird does <em>not</em> make the same mistakes as that villain JJ Abrams: the MacGuffin has a satisfying big red button that deactivates an in-flight nuclear missile. <p>Overall, I really liked the Kremlin sequence and the Burj Khalifa sponcon. Good Léa Seydoux moments. There seems to be consensus that <em>Fallout</em> is the best of these—up next.

Somehow bad in exactly the opposite way that the previous movie was bad. MI2 is bizarrely paced and frequently boring, but it has crispy, small-scale action scenes and a plot that makes intuitive sense in a "what if you could have a threesome with yourself" way. <p>MI3 has a competent script and a great villain, but a plot so hollow they wink about it at the end. PSH delivers a dynamite line—after being dangled from a cargo bay midair—about how what he's selling and who he's selling to are the least of Hunt's worries. This turns out to be "true" in the sense that the answers to these questions are neither revealed nor relevant, but that line would hit a lot harder if we had ever found what his real worries were! JJ Abrams has a lot of contempt for you, the viewer of franchise cinema, and we really should have stopped him right here.<p>Points added for Keri Russell, and for Hunt being really passionate about traffic engineering; points removed for the <em>conspicuous</em> lack of doves.

There's a hint of magic to how little sense this makes. Ostensibly they're trying to figure out who the agency moles are, but they forget about that for a little while, then they say they've got bigger fish to fry, then they remember and set a little trap, then the trap works, then they forget about it again, then they manage to kill a middleman and some of his goons.<p>It's kinda like a drug version of that one Captain America movie where it's spies and conspiracies all the way down—there's really nothing to figure out, you just feel creeped out by the system. Everyone said that was pretty good but I was making out in the theater for most of it (hey-oh!) so I don't remember too much.<p>Perfect setting. Made me homesick, of course. That's really what it feels it like to take 195 to 95 south.

Watched this is honor of setting up my movie server and adding our family DVDs, which naturally comprises things that I watched growing up. This is the one that called out to me.<p>My favorite Pixar, unless you put a gun to my head and told me to keep this or <em>Toy Story</em>. I like that it's Cool and has Concepts. The nuclear family angle also gives the story arc a different balance than most Pixar movies, even the best of which can be largely described as "unlikely friends go on an adventure." The conflicts are approachable at all ages, whether or not you are familiar with the various pains of having a middle-school crush, going through a mid-life crisis, suspecting your partner of infidelity, or filing an insurance claim (I saw Micheal Moore's <em>Sicko</em> when I was 11 and went oh!).<p>It has still-timeless art design that you can read about in <a href="http://www.spyparty.com/2012/08/27/the-new-spyparty-character-art-style/">this blog post from mostly-forgotten 2010s video game <em>Spy Party</em></a>. The score is arguably even better. Lots of iconic lines. <p>Love love love everything that happens once Helen is on the plane. There's so much cool shit. What's up with the spinning blade gyrocopters! "The remote controls the robot!"<p>The movie is basically perfect, is what I'm saying. I got kinda sad when it was over.

If you think biopics are Low Art that's fine but this is a very good one!<p>Best scene is when he shows up late to Pete Seger's public access television show, but then proceeds to quite gently initiate a heartwarming jam session with himself, Seger, and the older Black musician who is Seger's guest. It takes place at an interesting moment in the plot, which jostles your expectations a smidge and definitively establishes the movie's "take" on Dylan—as do the Guthrie bookends.<p>I have close to zero knowledge of Bob Dylan and I was also impressed at how well the music was integrated. There's a ton of it and they're miraculously among the parts I most enjoyed watching.<p>Acting-wise I think this movie validates my theory of what Timmy is good at ("well yeah, he shouldn't be Batman" —my dad). I loved Nice Ed Norton and thought he sold the stakes in the least hokey way possible—the teaspoon brigade speech works. And yes, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez did melt my brain a little bit.<p>Underrated line delivery, in response to an obvious set-up: "I love that guy."

woman next to me had a short seizure right after the movie started, but didn't realize she'd had a seizure (I think?) so when I try to ask "are you okay," she was confused and a little annoyed, which was a hard situation to explain while a live birth was happening in front of us.<p>her friend watched all this take place—with concern—and the two of them left shortly after.<p>in the Q&A, the director said she was inspired by <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, which I clocked immediately, and by <em>watching a lot of video game streams during the pandemic</em> which I did not pick up on at all but is AWESOME and she captured that feeling PERFECTLY. That fact adds so much to the visual language of film, starting with the scene where Nina picks the guy up on the side of the road.<p>massive massive content warning, but I got a lot out of it in the end.

First time that I can recall watching this since I saw it as my birthday party when it came out. I've probably seen it since then, but that's the core memory. It was on cable at the AirBnB and Kevin and I committed to it (by buying it on Amazon and hooking up my laptop instead).<p>As an adult, the signifiers in this franchise feel almost deliberately hard to parse. "Why <em>is</em> everyone in the capitol in drag?" Kevin asked at one point. I don't think they're in drag, exactly, and the actual answer is probably "to provide an opulent contrast with the downtrodden outer districts," but yeah, I see it.<p>We watched this over two days because we were too exhausted from skiing and as the second afternoon wore on I started to look forward to finishing it. This movie inculcated a lifelong affection for such actors as Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland, in that as a middle schooler I had a vague idea that they were Real Actors in a Movie I Liked  (Elizabeth Banks I like because of 30 Rock). Nostalgia is okay sometimes.

Courageous and essential narrative choice to have the building that's going to demolish the ballpark be a middle school. I think that's actually the detail from the trailers that convinced me this would be good. Ninety-eight saccharine minutes of rec league baseball and male friendship are fully cut by the fact that no one in their right mind would leave this movie thinking "what do those kids need a middle school for anyway?"<p>Speaking of male friendship: basically none of these guys are really friends. They just play baseball together (it's pretty hard to field an adult baseball team, even in whenever this is supposed to be set). Are cross-generational common spaces getting rarer, or am I just now approaching the age where they start to happen? I filled in for Josh's softball team not that long ago and I'm pretty sure everyone there was within 5 years of age and had an email job.<p>Funny, charming, biting, and kind. A good place to spend time even when it drags—just like a baseball game.

My first introduction to Joan Didion's whole deal. <p>I'm guessing this worked better as a book, where Maria's existential struggle could be given the inner voice it probably deserves. I could never fully hate a movie that's this formally inventive, but did not find that the engaging cinematography or mixed-medium aspects connected to the story in a meaningful way.<p>Like <em>Winter Kills</em>, which I also saw at Film Forum with Parker and which also involves Anthony Perkins, this film is tremendously romantic about a subculture of American gentry which has been almost completely swallowed up by time, only for Southwestern Ranch instead of New England Prep. The intersection of these two is, of course, Lana Del Rey.<p>I really enjoyed Anthony Perkins' performance, his outfits, and his hair. I completely missed that his character was supposed to be gay, which did have me slightly reconsider what message the outfits send, but nevertheless will by trying to see if I can pull off the two collar situation (in a straight way) at some point in the future.

Has that special insanity sauce that Bong brings to his English-language films for some reason. Kinda switches gears thematically halfway through—I uhhhhh would have liked to see more of the love square. Playing different versions of yourself is very in these days; glad we got Pattinson in on it so that both of him could be as freaky and sloppy as possible.

Watched in two parts: the first half with my parents and the second half on my own in New York, after which I called my dad to talk about it. My mom wanted a "mainstream movie" and I suffered a little bit of blowback about whether Kubrick constitutes a "mainstream" director.<p>I looked up Kubrick's biography after this. I didn't realize he was an American-born expat living in the UK. That makes a lot of sense for this movie, which has an American shape but a European heart—an epic rise and fall story anchored by Barry being fundamentally undeserving of a place in society due to his low birth.<p>Barry is a scoundrel and a bit of a fool—a "twisted Forest Gump," as my mom put it—but these qualities are tied to his class at every opportunity. In the first long scene, he courts his cousin Nora, who pulls a flirty trick in which she places a kerchief in her bosom; it is later revealed, in a hilarious sight gag, that Nora has used this trick <em>many</em> times. Barry's doting mother joins him for part 2, in which she immediately scolds him to scheme harder, to secure his son's position in society.<p>The aristocracy's own venality and cruelty underscores how Barry could never hope to earn a place there. He's a common thief. In the film's most riveting sequence, he offers mercy and vulnerability to the stepson he marginalized, mercy that that the stepson was never going to reward. It's just about the only moral thing we see Barry do. It has no place in this story, or this world.

Interesting use of murder as a metaphor (of sorts) for ambition in America. It would take him too long to get a house the normal way, you see.<p>Like <em>King of Comedy</em>, which I somewhat randomly re-watched just before this, the movie makes a lot more sense when you understand it through the lens of who makes the unflappable protagonist uncomfortable: service workers.<p>I liked that the target was unrelentingly irritating. She sure could play the piano, though.

I figured there's no way that context from <i>Mothra</i> (the movie) would be essential to understanding this one. That's technically true, but I looked it up on Wikipedia and the plot summary actually answers a lot of questions that this movie raised for me. Definitely not essential though—you'll pick up on the basics quickly. <p>I loved the ending where he's getting string-shotted, but the movie is solid all the way through. Also there's a couple Godzilla reaction shots that made me laugh out loud.

I spent most of this clutching a bulbasaur plushie that Morry's friend's roommate told me was named Paul Dano. I felt obligated to match her pronunciation of DAN-o even though I thought the actor was pronounced DAY-no—maybe the bulbasaur pronounces it differently. I frequently shielded Paul Dano's eyes.<p>Thought this was vapid and vile, but it's unquestionably successful as an eruption of untargeted disturbing images from which you cannot help but get splattered by a couple metaphors that you connect with. <p>For instance: the movie deliberately never answers the question of whether these two share a consciousness. Basically all the dramatic beats (the chicken leg, the kicking) suggest that they do not, but the exposition (the SUPERHOT-style REMEMBER YOU ARE ONE, RESPECT THE BALANCE stuff) keeps contradicting that. These moments clearly evoke self-harm and self-hatred, and you'll definitely <em>feel</em> that, but you're doing a lot of the film's narrative work for it because it doesn't establish any self for these characters at all.<p>You can do similar legwork for the film's other bizarre and underwritten aspects. There is essentially zero world building, which would be fine if Hollywood depicted here didn't feel like it was drawn from the memory of a 1950s network broadcast and a damp copy of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.<p>Obviously I found the dinner date scene gutting. It is also 100% disconnected from the science fiction, which conspicuously fails to heighten or emphasize the stakes of the scene in any way.<p>To each their own, and this is <em>absolutely</em> not my kind of movie, but as far as thoughtful depictions of the relationship between aging Hollywood stars and their younger contemporaries in an evolving but enduringly misogynistic media environment go—my mom and I are both enjoying <em>Hacks</em>.

I'm never really prepared for the depths of George's bitterness. Grabbing his uncle by the coat while shouting that he's a stupid old fool, snapping at his daughter to stop playing the piano, and, of course, pouting his way through an excruciating courtship of the love of his life—there will never a be rewatch where these scenes don't devastate me.<p>Although it's not nearly as heartbreaking, the Potter arc is equally grim. Potter is a mean, crafty old man at the beginning and a mean, crafty old man at the end (he's pretty funny too). He learns nothing, never changes, and even increases his hold over the town despite the competition. That the 40s makeup tech can't effectively age actors down makes Jimmy Stewart an unconvincing teenager, but it adds a surreal inevitability to Lionel Barrymore's Mr. Potter, who embodies a quintessentially American spirit that can never be defeated, only resisted. George Bailey's big win is that he endures.<p>It's easy to laugh at Frank Capra's vision of unchecked decadence (dancing! the bad kind!), and the silly linearity of the notion that an entire transport of troops owes their life to a nine year-old's actions two decades prior. What's not silly is the idea that you shape the world by being in it—not through butterfly effect, but in the grooves you wear into your neighborhood by walking its streets every day. Your community reflects your values because you are a part of it.<p>Although public broadcasting famously resurrected it, <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> will outlast all the Christmas Classics that are losing their luster in the twilight of liner television. This is partly because it pulls very few punches—George's resentment at what his selflessness has gotten him will always feel timeless. But it's also because, like George Bailey, we will always need reminding that goodness is its own reward, and we're all deserving of grace when we forget.

This one introduces some additional core Godzilla concepts: namely that Godzilla fights other monsters—if not necessarily on our behalf, at least to our benefit—and that sometimes Godzilla is just hanging out. I'm not sure he wouldn't have stayed quietly on that island if you'd just let him.<p><em>Godzilla Raids Again</em> replaces the quite somber scientist's dilemma in <em>Godzilla</em> (1954) with a sillier plot about two pilots who are best friends, one of whom is dating a radio operator who is also to boss' daughter. Relatively entertaining all the way through, but I was very into the last 15 minutes or so, in which the Japanese Air Defense Force relentlessly bombs a mountain in order to bury Godzilla in an avalanche. It's completely over the top and Godzilla seems mad as hell about it.

Made me think of JRod, my high school art history teacher who collected a great many toys of various kinds but had a special place in his heart for Godzilla and Godzilla merchandise, a couple of which were permanently placed on his desk between the computer dock and the student petitioner. They were somewhat precariously placed—his desk was full of toys and also teaching materials—so we often knocked over the Godzillas (and one Creature From The Black Lagoon) by accident and then he'd get fake mad.<p>While much of the movie does look like a child smashing a very expensive playset, even unconvincing special effects can be very startling in how non-uniformly they fail to look real. There are cuts from the man-in-suit Godzilla to giant superimposed Godzilla that really hit. I absolutely love the freeze-frame of the first appearance of his face.<p>There's always a bureaucratic element to Godzilla movies, because Godzilla tests mankind's collective response to crises (we do not always succeed). I liked Serizawa, and his pained recognition that the price of stopping Godzilla in the manner society demands is a little bit of our humanity—a price he pays mostly on his own.

Tried to time my vaccine chills with plans to see this movie but apparently you need to make an appointment (you can walk-in for the flu vaccine but not the COVID one) so I had to go back at 4:30 which was too late so I started to get shivery only when the movie ended and now I'm probably not going to sleep very well.<p>The single lamest thing a movie can do is flash back to the events of a previous movie with reverence. Even <em>The Force Awakens</em> managed to scrape up enough dignity to avoid doing that. <em>Star Wars</em> continues its unfortunate streak as the American cultural Cassandra—when Harrison Ford as Han Solo said "damn they just built another one and now we have to do the same shit again?" (paraphrasing), I felt a pit in my stomach that should have been even deeper. By the time <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> rolled around I didn't really have it in me to care. This movie stole Tom Cruise's "thanks for coming to the theaters" shtick too. <em>Top Gun</em> deserved it more.<p>Plot boring; sharks cool.

My dad's favorite movie. My mom likes it a lot too.<p>Watched this at the end of high school, I think, and it had close to zero impact on me. I remembered the car bomb vividly, as well as the final shot, but that's about it.<p>I don't really understand why this was. It's not like other great grim, talky films didn't hit me around that age—<em>Fargo</em> comes immediately to mind. Nor do I think it's inaccessible to teenagers—apparently it kicked off both a <em>coasa nostra</em> phase and an Al Pacino phase for my mom when she first saw it. Maybe it's personal taste, maybe it's because teenage culture isn't downstream of movies anymore, and the window for (slightly) less accessible entertainment to penetrate is narrower.<p>In any case, I get it now. From start to finish I loved it. Nice to watch with my family while home for Thanksgiving—something for everyone.<p>Al Pacino phases might be hereditary, though. "That's my family Kay. It's not me."

The thing that sticks is how the confidence and competence with which Ani begins the film—total queen of her domain—creates this space in the middle where we, the audience, realize that this marriage is toast—because of course of it is!—but we incorrectly assume that Ani understands this as well. Realizing that Ani, despite her incredible savvy, is still <em>genuinely</em> holding onto the fantasy, is a pretty brutal punch—especially after the movie has long since transitioned into slapstick zaniness.<p>The middle is incredibly funny and it pulls off the tone shift so smoothly you wonder whether a tone shift actually occurred or if you, too, were a bit delusional. Last scene is real "gaping at the screen" situation.<p>Last summer, I made Spencer trek with me down to Brighton Beach to see <em>Oppenheimer</em> because it was the only IMAX screen left. We wandered around the beach and the boardwalk for a while afterwards. I think it's kind of a magical place—reminds me more of Miami than anywhere else in New York. It's so funny how they all pile into that stupid white Escalade increasingly worn down by the night. Life does that to you sometimes; shame it's only magical in retrospect.

A year or two ago my friend Ryan wrote that the Swaggy Balenciaga AI Pope (sorry if this is the first you're hearing about that) fooled so many people because "the pope aesthetically exists in the same uncanny valley as most AI art." <em>Conclave</em> has as a similar relationship to Catholicism's visual grammar: the hotel rooms that evidently exist within the Vatican would not be out of place in a spaceship; the conclave all eat in their matching robes in what could absolutely be a prison cafeteria; and yes, that one Cardinal hits some very catty vapes.<p>Astonishingly pleasing, the cinematography drives home the movie's most consistent message: that this aesthetic is maintained by a lot of other people's—women's—hard work. And, by implication, that everything intimidating and appealing about this aesthetic is plunder from the labor and wealth of others. The movie actually isn't particularly interested in the church—<em>Fleabag</em>, to use a slightly random example, has a lot more to say about Catholicism—but it is interested in gender. It's best moments are things like when Sister Agnes has to help him use a copy machine. <p>I mean, it's never not funny to see someone dressed like that try to use a copy machine.<p>The ending fell flat for me though. A little too neat, a little too preachy. The liberals win off the strength of a good speech. The new pope is intersex. Tedesco is not rewarded for calling Muslims "animals." I supposed these kinds of mysteries do typically wrap up cleanly with a pat little moral, but this particular moral felt somewhat disconnected from both the drama of the film and the moment we're living in. Aaron Sorkin's President Bartlet has a more compelling crisis of faith in a church, and that church didn't have Michelangelo's <em>Last Judgement</em> staring back at him.<p>Really did have a great time and immediately recommended it to my parents though. It's always fun to watch Ralph Fiennes do his thing.

For men of certain ambition, resources, and stature, there comes a moment in which they finally heed the call to immolate their finances and career in pursuit of their own <em>Bishock Infinite</em> (although in this case it appears that Coppola has more recently read <em>The Power Broker</em>, instead of <em>Devil in the White City</em>). It is our duty, as a society, to encourage them to do so.<p>Cool! But not not a catastrophic pile-up of crumpled ideas. <p>It's pretty funny how he leads off with this high concept New Rome stuff and then just every single shot is iconic New York landmarks. Coppola really, really, wants to emphasize that this isn't a New York-inspired fable city, it is literally New York, but in costume. There are also, if you're keyed into the Robert Moses stuff, a distracting number of Catalina-as-Moses moments—from the unelected "Design Authority" down to the way he's always chauffeured around. The various nods to Moses criticisms ("what about the people already there?"; "he'll bankrupt the city before he realizes his dream") hit a little different when—spoilers—Catalina ends up being right about everything and building utopia.<p>Speaking of utopia—apparently it's about open discourse (this airily democratic concept is floated repeatedly), although utopia is achieved through the character who most openly does not tolerate dissent. So that should give you an idea of how coherent all this is. The McFlurry of Ideas blends fascist and neo-fascist imagery in a good-hearted boomer liberal sort of way, although it ranges from the blunt (red hats, Pulcher getting Mussolinied) to the baffling (swastika tree stump?). Having all the elites assume debaucherous Roman dress sends a very obvious message that is wildly undercut by the finale of the film, which lionizes the visionary—and the elites—at the expense of decaying democratic institutions Coppola is nominally interested in defending.<p>New York mayor gets booed every time he appears in public is a truly inspired bit.<p>Everyone seems to be in a different movie. Adam Driver, one of my favorite working actors, is in a psychedelic arthouse masterpiece of some sort, but his surroundings are too weird (or maybe the wrong kind of weird) to highlight it; if you swapped his character into the most recent <em>Batman</em>, in place of Batman, I think it would have worked a lot better. The mayor and his daughter are both quite forgettable, mainly because they embody the weaknesses of Coppola's argument about liberal democracy (to the extent that he has one). The Jon Voight thing ends up paying off. Aubrey Plaza's performance is fabulous, even if it's just a nuclear-grade sexy version of Aubrey Plaza's brand (and Wow Platnium is an <em>amazing</em> name). She and Shia LeBeouf (!) were by far the best part of the movie for me—as goofy as his subplot was, it did have a consistent and effective tone.<p>Coppola has an eye for who's cool that is absolutely essential for a great director. Really enjoyed seeing Chloe Fineman pop a bunch, because her character is nonexistent but her face is so distinct. <p>I had fun, but you asked me to keep this or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, I'd take the latter. <em>Megalopolis</em> would have benefited from a George Washington Gatling Gun mech.<p>EDIT: Almost forgot to comment on how the "Virgin Pop Star" who was "outed" as having had sex by a deepfaked video comes back exactly once, in an interstitial that shows she's rebranded as like an Avril Lavigne punk type. That rocked.

If you're wondering whether this outrageously self-indulgent picture that dissects many of the same themes with the same actors in the same genre as many of this director's most famous movies is worth watching: yes, I'm sorry, it's terrific. <p>Obviously it's too long but all the other stuff is kind of justified. Scorsese allows his familiar tropes to disintegrate into bitter ash and lonely fluorescent lights. I'm not sure it would hit quite the same with fresher faces. <p>Chilling, career-best performance from Joe Pesci. My dad and I were both blown away by him.

Watched this with my parents, which was fun. Starts off whipping cliches all over the place, and then suddenly the dialogue really locks in for about an hour, once they get to Evans' house. For a while it's a real treat to watch. Both Crowe and Bale settle in perfectly to their characters, and Ben Foster is very unsettling as Wade's creepy lieutenant.<p>Godawful ending though. The tightness of the script until that point led us all to believe that the high stakes climax would be resolved with some interesting character-driven plot developments! But instead it just turned into Indiana Jones. Ah well.

My long string of good luck with air travel came to an abrupt end today when I was placed in a middle economy seat at the back of a plane for the 3.5 hour flight from Salt Lake City to Detroit. I decided the best way to make it through was to just stay put, have two watery coffees, and watch a movie. So it came to pass that I, like tens of thousands of airborne Americans before me, watched the 2023 Glen Powell/Sydney Sweeney rom-com <i>Anyone But You</i>.<p>Glen Powell's seemingly instant omnipresence has made some people feel like he's a sterile excuse for a movie star, but I think this misses the mark—he's a millennial, they're just like that. Movie stardom, as a concept, skipped a generation, and then threw a fully-formed 35 year-old man at us along with Zendaya, Austin Butler, and Anya Taylor-Joy. I just love the guy. The thing where he's super cocky but always looks like he would appreciate a good hug is perfect for this kind of movie, and he obviously carries it. Consider me charmed.<p>Sydney Sweeney, meanwhile, is pretty bad but in a way that's far more interesting. She's awful at witty repartee, she matches no one's energy, and she has very little chemistry with her costar. But she's incredibly expressive physically, both through her face and body movements, and occasionally the movie takes advantage of these strengths—like in the silly but cute opening sequence, and a wonderfully stupid bit that takes place on a airplane.<p>This movie actually kind of clicks into place if you view it through a tired-in-other-contexts generational disconnect. The jokes about Ben's age, and him being possibly a bit old for her, are funny and plausible. Bea's best moments are when she is genuinely flabbergasted by Ben's deeply millennial sincerity: both her "what the <em>fuck</em>" when she hears what's on Ben's headphones, and "saying 'cringe' is also cringe, old man" really made me chuckle. <p>Millenial cornball tries to win over irony-poisoned Gen Z disaster girl—<em>that's</em> a premise. It's arguably this premise! It's the meta-case that a 2023 rom-com is making to a moviegoing audience that doesn't know how to be unselfconscious, because they came of age in an era where the camera has always been pointing back at them.<p>You can imagine a good version of this movie that doesn't derive its stakes from largely fake, off-screen traumas that neither lead is really equipped to communicate, but instead from tensions inherent to their coupling that we see evolve throughout the film.<p>A bunch of silly Australians really have a go as well, and that's quite a lark. I thought all the supporting characters were great (except for Ben's ex).

This feels like a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, if Paul Thomas Anderson made movies I like (he's great! just not usually my taste). The opening sequence is so intensely stylized—and Travis' behavior so bizarre—that for the rest of the film to unfold as a relatively grounded family drama instead of a García Marquez story unmoors the viewer in ways that more surreal choices would not have.<p>Instant admittance for Dean Stockwell into the pantheon of child performances, although I must reiterate my belief that child acting should probably be illegal. The scene where Walt and Travis walk home—first doing bits at each other from across the street, and then together when Travis realizes it's okay—is one of many things that made me tear up. Although nothing like that hug at the end. Oof.<p>Shot of Anne in the spaceship bedroom (that last time we see either of them!!) is a full-body blow.<p>I'm assembling a lookbook of every Harry Dean Stanton outfit in this movie.

The Lesser Scorseses are where it's at.<p>In the first half of the film, Scorsese stylizes Rupert Pupkin in extreme contrast with his surroundings—his three-piece suits pop against the dingy bar and imagined conversations with Jerry take place in his mom's basement. You are meant to understand him as a man deeply out of touch with reality.<p>But nobody actually treats him that way. Rita knows what he's like and goes on an underwhelming date with him anyway, finishing with the saddest "well you can come upstairs I guess" I've ever heard. Jerry not only deals with people like Pupkin every day, he somewhat relishes the opportunity to put him in his place rather than have the cops take care of it. Ms. Long (one of my favorite performances here, from Shelly Hack) knows exactly how to handle pushy comedians in the lobby, and successfully dispatches him multiple times without ever losing her cool. Pupkin's tactics are extreme but his sociopathic behavior is, to the many recognizably normal people in the film, relatively expected.  <p>The viciously funny ending confirms that Rupert, unbalanced as he is, correctly read society's social cues and took the necessary steps to take advantage of them. He's not especially deluded, he just did a cost-benefit analysis and came out ahead. It reminded me of the on-screen YouTube comments in the first episode of Black Mirror: "prime minister gonna get pig AIDS lmao". <p>Imagine if Scorsese had lived to see 2024, where new forms of mass media have made American culture is more dominant than ever and virality endows us all with the chance to be "King for a Day"—*taps earpiece* I'm getting word that he makes TikToks with his Gen Z daughter. <p>The least self-aware thing Pupkin does in the whole movie is say "I'm not like you" to Masha at the beginning. <em>That</em> he believes.<p>Masha and Jerry scene is something else.<p>I think that watching this in theaters caused Parker physical pain.

In high school, I had a bunch of friends staying over for reasons I cannot recall and, late at night, we clicked this pretty much randomly. When Serena dropped "we did like a reverse <em>Blind Side</em>" (to date my favorite line delivery by a non-actor), I knew we hit a good one; when we got to the courtroom sketch digression, it felt like winning the lottery.<p>While it's obviously impossible to recreate that perfect experience, this holds up as one of the best Samberg-verse productions. It nails the vibe of a 30-for-30 while gleefully over-committing to some incredibly silly (and visually diverse!) bits. I'm sorry but if the Sweedish prison animations don't make you laugh there's something broken inside you. I'm just now realizing how much of <em>American Vandal</em> was likely inspired by this.<p>Another thing that makes this special is that it draws from a much wider pool of talent than the SNL extended roster. Getting famous sports personalities to say funny things is always a winner—and John McEnroe was in "I Just Had Sex", lest you forget—but there are lots of dramatic actors with comedy chops that you don't normally see next to Fred Armisen. Kit Harrington's physical awkwardness is such a great spin on his general vibe, and both Mary Steenburgen and Karen Gillan have perfect timing as well. But my favorite cutaway is Lena Dunham absolutely chewing insane lines about white denim; I love her confidence and her portrayals of confidence.<p>Have decided this counts as a movie. Why shouldn't movies be 40-odd minutes? Let's make more of those.

Lots of people missing the heterosexual subtext: male friendship can be so beautiful.<p>I understand there's a lot of structural problems with the movie business, but every time a movie that nerds like does poorly (sorry, <em>Furiosa</em>) people proclaim the death of cinema. Meanwhile a mid-budget bi-curious tennis movie with a new star and two relative unknowns (sorry, Josh O'Connor, who I just realized was Prince Charles on <em>The Crown</em>) makes double its budget and... crickets.<p>Instead of leaning out of the lightly preposterous story, the comically intrusive—and absolutely electric—Reznor/Ross club soundtrack lets you revel in its camp. Makes me want to watch one of those animes that's all about volleyball and every serve takes up an entire episode.<p>Obviously Tashi is evil and no one has a personality outside of tennis, but American culture is deeply stacked in favor of psychos who care about nothing but winning.

Apocalypse movie where everyone is in denial that they live in the apocalypse is a <i>fascinating</i> premise. Maybe I'm biased from having seen the later ones, but even in the world of this film it seems clearly insane to send your wife and child out alone so often. The various islands of sanity—the hospital, the beach house, the police station I guess—are apparently sufficient to ignore the rising tide of madness.<p>A somewhat unpleasant film limited by the era, the budget, and the genre—this sort of exploitation movie isn't really what I like—but deeply compelling in the context of Miller's body of work. Right from the start, Miller gives agency and power to vulnerable characters without compromising what makes them vulnerable in the first place. The old lady with the shotgun briefly saves the day, but she's still an old lady up against a barn full of biker rapists.<p>Miller appears to believe in a collective inner madness—a cackling goblin in our heads—that we all either choose to fight or let flourish, and the apocalypse is an opportunity to really let loose if that's what you were predisposed to doing. <p>Mel Gibson doesn't do it for me. Watched a young Clint movie and I was like "hell yeah, Clint is the man," but did not get that feeling even slightly from this. Maybe it's because he's Australian?

I'm an easy mark for the basic but effective storytelling trick where time passes and you have to fill in the blanks about the rise and fall of the Dementus empire. "Oh, the horns guy got fed up with him." Makes me feel like a smart little cookie. <p>Speaking of The Octoboss—great. "You're scum, Dementus," is one of the best-delivered lines in the movie; Dementus just sort of rolls his eyes. He adds depth to the dynamic of the horde while also being a gratifyingly preposterous component of it. Miller nails that balance over and over.<p>Suffers from the fact that you miss <em>Fury Road</em> while watching it.

Flight 2/2 on my transatlantic flight.<p>I really appreciated that this movie about making an exploitative, one-dimensional black family story revealed itself to be a moving, multi-generational black family story. "Good", Monk says, about the point he's trying to make with his novel, "because it's not particularly subtle." <p>The satire is intended to be the "easier" part of the story, and its targets are often very broad in a way that serves that overall aim. I don't think a ton of white people imagine themselves to be the book publisher lady, but it's easy to spot that tendency in yourself. A lot of those jokes have a "calling-in" vibe, and that's not necessarily a bad thing: it doesn't lessen Monk's criticism of the bookstore to note that the gangly white teen he's chastising has no agency there.<p>But honestly, I just loved the family story. I'm at the age where these family dynamics are becoming intelligible to me, even if I'm not at this stage in my life yet. The performances are exceptional, the writing is terrific, and I just thought it was a darn good movie!

Film 1/2 in my transatlantic flight. I had to stay up the whole time to reset my clock so it would have been very reasonable to watch three, but I did a little reading and coding instead. <p><em>Insomnia</em> is a Christopher Nolan movie starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams that almost no one talks about, which is not a good sign. The movie is thankfully quite solid, but what it has to say about all these men's careers is more interesting than the text of the film itself.<p>Felt an involuntary smile come on in the first two minutes, when I realized Al Pacino was going to be good in this, a movie made after 1998. Dormer's relationship with Swank's Detective Burr holds the whole thing together—he can't bring himself to sabotage or even deflate her. Many of Pacino's best characters wear their heart on their sleeve while defiantly pretending not to. This is necessary to keep you rooting for this broken cop.<p>Many familiar Christopher Nolan themes are germinating here, particularly the comforting, incoherent politics of the Batman movies. He's way too competent, even at this stage, to mess up a noir. Man vs man, Man vs nature, Man vs self: we've got em all, and they all connect. There's a little bit of <em>Twin Peaks</em> in the premise but Nolan wisely does not try to emulate Lynch's themes at all; it's more of a hat tip that acknowledges they both find this part of the country pretty neat.<p>Nice to see Robin Williams crush a role with no comedy at all. Despite the film's tagline calling him brilliant, Finch is not particularly smart, he's just a creep who know his way around, and Williams conveys that perfectly.<p>Finally, it is more-than-somewhat implied that Domer, having been awake for 140 hours, had sex with the really hot innkeeper before driving to the finale.

Each Ocean's movie is an experiment in how few cinematic contrivances are actually required to create the feeling that you're just one of Clooney's gang. Danny Ocean knows you, and he's fond of you; Rusty knows you too, and he thinks you're alright; Terry Benedict is not your friend, but he respects you and your interactions are full of barbed banter.<p>This one just doesn't do it for me. They're pulling a heist to revive their friend after a heart attack? But also, he revives himself halfway through? No one has any real motivations and there's very little thought put into why they or I should care, other than that I like <em>Ocean's</em> and should want to see the gang together. They like each other a lot, clearly I should too!<p>I should stop, but also—heist movies have to have a CLICK moment and this one absolutely does not. They say "we're gonna rig your games so you lose a lot of money" and that happens. They say "Linus is gonna flirt with the lady and open up the diamond room" and that happens. The only twist, if you want to call it that, is that the cop is Matt Damon's dad and that is a lame as hell twist even though they squeeze a couple good jokes out of it. In the first movie, they faked an entire SWAT team!<p>The insurmountable obstacle is a computer system that they turn off (differently, this time) with literally zero drama.<p>It's a shame, because sometimes <em>Ocean's Thirteen</em> is pretty amusing. The factory subplot with Casey Affleck's atrocious Spanish starts funny and gets funnier every time. Twilight-career Al Pacino is Al Pacinoing hard. Matt Damon and Bernie Mac and that electronics guy—all good! But overall, the movie is such a slog that it's hard to appreciate all the good elements.<p>I feel like Soderbergh could have been something interesting thematically about the changing Vegas and changing times for Danny Ocean—there's an intriguing wistfulness to the screenplay and cinematography—but I don't know, maybe those themes should have been worked into the mechanics of the interminable "heist" that this movie is ostensibly supposed to be about.

Diving into the career of 93-year-old Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood from vantage point of 2024 is a surreal experience where you watch a handful of really interesting movies, and then you take a step onto a missing stair and tumble face-first into an miasmatic abyss of American id that Eastwood defined, in true Eastwood character fashion, seemingly by accident and pure instinct.<p>This is a pretty solid movie that makes zero goddamn sense. <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em> defies the midwit cultural analysis that defines my letterboxed page: I could either use  as a fulcrum for a PhD thesis, or I could just watch it while falling asleep on a Tuesday, but I certainly can't write two mildly interesting paragraphs about it for my friends to read on the toilet.

The first 10 minutes depict a dehumanizing medical exam in which a doctor attempts to determine the likelihood that his patient, a nude French woman hugging herself for modesty, is Jewish, using heuristics such as the shape of her nostrils. He decides that, for the moment, her case remains inconclusive. <p>The eponymous protagonist of <em>Mr. Klein</em>—a man whose venality would be unremarkable in most other contexts—is aware of these exams, and the events that make them necessary. But he is a small man, whose small world purposefully lacks the space to consider them. And he will become obsessed with a question whose answer he—and his fellow enablers—are categorically incapable of understanding.

Thought this was charming and nice. <p>The movie did not sell me on her relationship with her husband, which was maybe necessary for the story tension, but felt sort of cheap—either Hae Sung's reappearance complicates a very good marriage or it complicates a kind of mediocre marriage; even if Song wanted us to draw our own conclusions, I think we would have benefit from a lot more detail there.<p>The acting was terrific. Photographically, among the most beautiful modern New York movies I've ever seen; I really am out here living in the big city :`)

It's unfair how good this is.<p>Part Two has something to say. It actually makes its point somewhat better than the even the <em>book</em> does, because it forefronts the worldbuilding that frames Paul's crusade as inevitable (a possible but undifferentiated outcome of Bene Gesserit planning) and tragic (the revenge he wins on Arrakis is the beginning of a long, bloody Jihad). Given how (lovingly) impenetrable <em>Dune</em> can be on the page, this is a monumental achievement.<p>It is even more impressive given that Part Two has many of the same problems as the first, starting with Timothée Chalamet. It's not that he can't act—sometimes he's pretty good here. But I'm sorry he's just not an epic figure. His vibe is that he's a weird, charming lil' punk. He has no gravity, no chemistry with Zendaya, and too much chemistry with Rebecca Ferguson. Zendaya is better but since she only has Timothée to work with for the first of the film, it's a while before we actually get to see it. Big chunks of the first half feel stilted and self-important as a result.<p>And yet it mostly doesn't matter, because the embarrassment of riches filling out the rest of the cast pick up the slack. Rebecca Ferguson really delivers as Lady Jessica, serving mom and witch in terrifying superposition. Josh Brolin shows up playing a goofy little banjo tune and the warmth rushes back in. Bardem gives Stilgar life and nuance. Austen Butler swoops in to dominate a 30-minute sequence in the middle of the film; Léa Seydoux shows up to dominate him. Florence Pugh is very believable as a future empress. <p>In the final 40 minutes Villeneuve pulls off that magnificent trick not seen in high fantasy since the best of Game of Thrones, where big armies and big politics are happening simultaneously and this is somehow intelligible—and so, so <em>satisfying</em>. This what an epic fantasy blockbuster is supposed to do: justify its grandiosity with intrigue, carnage, and consequences at commensurate scale. I have my criticisms of Villeneuve's somewhat one-note industrial style, but if this isn't the franchise for it, I don't know what is.<p>Man that was cool.

"That question is leading. And a little sexist" objects Sandra's suspiciously hot lawyer/ex at the beginning of a 90 minute court proceeding that will soon prove to be nothing but leading. And sexist.<p><em>Anatomy of a Fall</em> asks the viewer: are women knowable? Just kidding (kind of). But Sandra's character does have this bizarre fractal quality where she seems to be obviously everything she's accused of, but also something else entirely. I think we're all like that, to some degree. I rarely disagree with even the harshest assessments of me—but they're always wrong. <p>Sandra lives through what, in 2024, we all sort of fear: that an adversary will pick your worst moments and array them in front of your for the clapping of a kangaroo court. Maybe you don't fear that; I spend a lot of time on the internet. Legally the whole things feels a little preposterous, but I simply must shrug my shoulders and say: France?<p>Funny as hell. Steel drums PIMP. Everything about the prosecutor.<p>I find it rather annoying when a movie hides the crucial facts and then asks us to judge—as this one does in especially tacky fashion, with a domain name—but, to be fair, that's how real juries work too. I was too moved by the the final 40 minutes to care too much either way. Beautifully staged final confrontations, starting with the recording. <p>What matters in the end is not the choice the mom is alleged to have made, but the one we know her son did.

I wasn't prepared for how deliberately silly this was. I've been doing a little googling and apparently not taking his film persona too seriously is a big part of Jackie Chan's thing. I just didn't know anything about Jackie Chan. We all have cultural holes. <p>Anyway this is cool and a great thing to watch after having a couple beers during the Super Bowl. This style of movie isn't really my thing—I don't love action-comedies, I've realized; the action doesn't land for me when the whole tone is kind of goofy—but I can recognize superior craftsmanship when I see it.<p>The telephones scene is a work of art, straight out of a '50s sitcom.

Ooooooofffff. But... maybe?<p>Released on probation after serving 7 years soft-cancelled for being too popular and too Kentucky, Jennifer Lawrence returns to theaters with a performance that not only reestablishes her specifically as someone you'd go to movies to see, but the mid-budget romcom as a <em>genre</em> that you'd go to the movies to see. Which is sort of bananas. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/10/15179082/anne-hathaway-publicity-cycle-hathahaters-jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift">We should stop doing that our female celebrities.</a><p>She and her co-star Andrew Barth Feldman are both so good it kind of justifies this excruciating premise. I barely made it through the middle but I thought the last 30 minutes or so were quite heartfelt, and delivered a genuinely emotional arc for each of them. Percy hesitating not because he's a geek but because he wants an emotional connection (and also because he's a geek) is really true to that type of kid.<p>"We don't judge sex work" is a great line and the movie mostly doesn't, somehow. When Maddie is yelling at Percy that he'll be fine but Maddie really needs that Buick, you're kinda like, yeah, she does really need that Buick. The class dynamic throughout is handled with something approaching subtlety (the gentrification plot a little less so).<p>The side characters are all great, the world mostly makes sense, it's pretty funny. It's a well-made movie and there's an even better one hiding inside it. I'm not going to get past the ickiness of that premise in this genre, but if I keep writing this review I'll talk myself into liking it more so I'm going to stop now.<p>There's a certain Al Pacino vibe to Jlaw's commitment here.

This is pretty atrocious. The pacing is awful, the world makes no sense, and the central conflict is essentially "suburban marriage comedy," which is probably not something I'd enjoy much even under the best of circumstances, which these are not. <p>I wasn't offended by it at all but this would have been unwatchable if not for the fact that in 2005, bad movies involved blowing up a very real-looking house in what one presumes is Connecticut; in 2024, bad movies are rendered in Unity.

I watched the second half of this first, which is not usually how you're supposed to watch movies. I joined my sister and my mom halfway through and then watched the first half two days later. I even watched most of the second part again. I don't think this colors my review too much, but in the interest of full disclosure I wanted to share.<p>One of those movies where Good Acting is for sure happening (as it does in every Carey Mulligan movie; Bradley Cooper no slouch either) but the movie otherwise fails to sell the importance of itself or its central character. Everyone involved obviously loves Leonard Bernstein, but if you didn't go in with that investment, you probably aren't going to leave with it.<p>I forgot that I sang "Make Our Garden Grow" in my college Glee Club.

This would have been bad if the acting wasn't so good. But the main trio are terrifically funny and they have such a good dynamic that it carries you through the slow parts. Bradley Cooper in particular is stunning. Heather Graham is also instantly recognizable to me, in that I always go "who was <em>that</em>" when I see her in something and then realize after the fact that she's Heather Graham; that part absolutely would not work with a lesser actress.<p>Only exception is Ken Jeong. I have never found Ken Jeong funny. I remember 2009 so I have the appropriate cultural context for it, and still don't like it. <p>Other clever touches pull the whole thing together. I especially liked that Phil appears to not, in fact, hate his life, and spends the entire last scene being a good dad. No one even remarks upon this, it just kind of adds some context to the character.<p>Surprisingly not awkward to watch with my parents.<p>Not kidding, the last shot and the credits montage is one of the best endings to a movie ever.

My favorite part of this film is how lazy the end state of totalitarianism is. This guy is a complete baby and he manages to escape mostly by just walking away. The cops are slow, the jail is unlocked, and the operation has to get called off if it exceeds 5% of its primary budget. It tracks that if society reaches a point where the drugs and generally oppressive vibe would do most of the work for the state, that would have eroded state capacity to maintain the vibe.<p>Lots of other weird, funny touches make this worth watching. The shots of CRT screens and the loudspeaker announcements are a bit cringeworthy at first but totally work once the pattern is established and he starts using them for little jokes. The operations lady denying responsibility was incredibly good. I'm also a huge fan of the guy who is a hologram (?)—who obviously interacts with the environment but also does some hologram things like not react when his ear is stapled. This is never resolved.<p>I'll admit it starts off pretty slow and is never altogether pleasant to watch, but I liked it. Every character feels human by the end—every one of their plots resolved in surprisingly moving and attentive fashion.

This movie had a big impact on me in high school, even though I don't relate to central premise at all and watched it for the lamest reason possible: to understand a Zizek metaphor.<p>The mid-air collision, the Pixies hand-hold, "waiting for their turn to talk," the smiling faces on the safety card, the recall formula, "you are not a special snowflake", single-serving friends, "his name is Robert Paulson"—I don't think any of these moments are particularly <i>deep</i> or whatever, I just think about them a lot. They make for a good movie.<p>My assistant debate coach told me that Helena Bonham Carter in this movie was his ideal woman, which is a weird thing to tell a 15 year-old. He moved to China a while ago and got married there. Best I can tell, his wife does not give Marla Singer vibes.<p>Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden is one of the greatest movie performances of all time.<p>Of the 1999 pop philosophy blockbusters about how having a condo and an office job is spiritual cancer, it's interesting that fascists generally appropriated imagery from <i>The Matrix</i> instead, because <i>Fight Club</i> is obviously more sympathetic to them. <p>Fincher's best films are about the rot at the center of American culture, and if you watch them too close to one another, it's hard to not to notice somewhat reactionary ideas about what <i>exactly</i> that rot is. <i>Fight Club</i> is not an endorsement of fight clubs, but it clearly thinks that white collar society is emasculating—and that somehow the "people who serve your food" must strike back against the liberal yuppie weenies who administer repressive globalist capital. The ending could be most charitably interpreted as saying: "okay, maybe a national terrorist cell of blue-collar dudes is a bit far, but their heart is in the right place."<p>If anything, redpilling is the dominant allegory for the far-right precisely because <i>Fight Club</i> is more clearly tuned into their concerns, so the mild critiques—like, for instance, that you end up in a cult of weird skinheads—hit a little harder if you're predisposed to agree with the general worldview. In <i>The Matrix</i>, you see through the bullshit, wake up the sheeple, and go home with the hot she/they. Much more aspirational.

Watched this at the beginning of my "movie era" and I was curious if I'd feel differently about it this time. I mostly didn't, but now I have a slightly better vocabulary to describe why.<p>This is a terrifically funny movie. The three leads are outstanding: Gleeson and Farrel have such incredible pathos together that it inspired McDonagh to do it all over again 15 years later, and Ralph Fiennes blasts into the third act playing... not against type, exactly, but a disarmingly silly version of a Ralph Fiennes type. <p>And McDonagh can turn up the empathy at any moment. The film hinges on the scenes where Ray and Ken go sightseeing together. What, to a hitman, is "culture?" Perhaps the only way to make sense of what he's done (if McDonagh were a little more comfortable going full Movie Mode, the final sequence with the Bosch-like costumed figures could have been something special instead of a clever footnote).<p>But yeesh it is dragged down by McDonagh's shock jock streak, with more than a handful of needlessly cruel bits framed in exactly the way someone would if they were waiting to jump out of the bushes and go <i>but don't you get that it shows the characters aren't good people</i>. Yes I know how to watch a movie. They also shoot each other. This should be a transcendent script, but by the third weird joke about black people—there are no black people with speaking roles—not to mention the "racist dwarf" character—explicitly referred to as such—it's obvious that McDonagh just likes the shock value too much to get out of his own way.

When Harry Lime finally shows up, it's obvious why Anna thinks Holly is so lame: Harry Lime is cool as hell. Holly is delusional for thinking that he could ever touch that charisma, or that he really has that much to offer anyway. That glance Harry gives when he's first illuminated—arresting! Orson Wells' screen presence was really something special.<p>If you choose to heed your moral compass, that had better be its own reward: sometimes it gets you the girl, and sometimes it just highlights what a wet noodle you are.

Right after Julianne Moore left her recurring gig on the show, Susan Sarandon had a <em>30 Rock</em> guest arc where she played Frank's teacher who'd been in prison for exactly the same reason as Moore's character in this movie. "You're like a little boy" she tells him at one point. "Oh I wonder why that is!" he yells back. "What could have happened to me in 7th grade to make me never want to grow up?"<p>Natalie Portman stars as the Lydia Tár of actresses portraying pedophiles in this far more serious, but also oddly comic, examination of the subject. And she's cookin'. Ice cold in the way that only superficially empathetic people can be, Elizabeth switches modes depending on how far she thinks she can get with each one—occasionally channeling movie star ("oh <em>thank</em> you") but more often a particular type of mom at the youth soccer end-of-year party. She somehow resists your observation—and condemnation—despite being more than worthy of it.<p>Props to the movie for—despite the darkly campy tone—not making a joke out of the central abuse story. Joe is heartbreaking. The butterfly metaphor was not terribly subtle but I found it affecting nonetheless. I hope he gets to start over.

My little brother was <em>dying</em> to see this because he has this chip on his shoulder about watching movies that he "shouldn't" with my dad. This is a little weird because he's a freshman in college—you can just watch whatever movies you want now, Andrew. It's fine. <p>This led to the funniest possible outcome which is that Andrew hated it but my dad was LOCKED in. Then Andrew pretended he'd never wanted to see it which annoyed the hell out of my dad. <p>The movie still delivers an amazing vibe. It's only about 10 minutes too long and the soundtrack is terrific. Adam Sandler drops his career best with an excellent supporting cast. Julia Fox had NYC media in a choke-hold for three years after this and she could it again anytime she please.<p>Idina Menzel laughing in Howie's face "you are the most annoying person I've ever met" is the most underrated moment from this film.<p>I do think that knowing what happens takes a little bit of the fun out of it. Could be just me, but something about the total lack of character development removes some of the rewatch value; Howard's choice to put it all on a three-way parlay doesn't seem nearly as insane when you know for an absolute fact that he could never possibly make a different decision. That's fine though, it's still a lot of fun.<p>

Emma Stone has such distinctive charisma, but also an incredible ability to manipulate it into the shape that the character demands. This movie would be so pedestrian without her—another weird Yorgos project with cute visuals, fisheye lens, and bonkers sexual dynamics; instead, it's a remarkable modern gothic, bogged down only by some uneven pacing in the last 40 minutes or so. It's Bella's movie, and Emma Stone makes it so.<p>She also manages to make Bella's journey fundamentally heroic despite the incredibly creepy dynamic of all these men trying to have sex with a mental child. Stone unflinchingly reflects this without once letting Bella be defined by or overwhelmed by it. She's incredible.<p>Willem Dafoe is also in the movie, along with a couple other men who don't detract from Emma Stone's masterpiece.

Hmmm.<p>I quite liked this when I first saw it and was much cooler on it this time. I think what happened between then and now is I saw the good cut of the original <em>Blade Runner</em> and I saw Villeneuve's <em>Dune</em>.<p>This is a solid sequel, and the light work is as dazzling as ever, but the whole production is, ironically, often very soulless. The Los Angeles of <em>Blade Runner</em> was a grimy city of the future; this LA barely seems to have anyone else besides the protagonists in it.<p>I've decided that Villeneuve's approach to sci-fi really relies on the acting to fill the cavernous gunmetal atriums with life. Amy Adams did it, but pretty much no one else has been up to the task. I do think that Sylvia Hoeks (doing a viscous twist on the first movie's Rachel) succeeds the most, and her snarling "I'm the best one" is the movie's only great line. Ana de Armas, two years away from being an A-lister, is the other highlight, and her portrayal of Joi is one of the few lasting cultural artifacts from this film. Not much to say about Gosling, who's over-underplaying it; Jared Leto is another unpleasant weird guy; Robin Wright is fine; Harrison Ford looks ever-so-slightly more interested in being this movie than he was to be in <em>Star Wars 7</em>.<p>Anyway I enjoyed the movie but now I know why almost nothing of it stuck with me the first time. Villeneuve doesn't trample on the source material, but he doesn't do too much else with it either.

I enjoyed watching this in a theater. They did a nice job making the battle strategies obvious with very little exposition. A whole movie of historical battle strategies might be fun.<p>Unfortunately, I saw <em>The Phantom Thread</em> a couple weeks before this, which did a far better job depicting the kind of relationship that Scott seems to be going for here. Just about every scene in Napoleon's personal life falls flat, except when he's being either insanely weird to politicians, which is hilarious, or a kindly mentor to random teens, which is charming and sweet.<p>I'm sure something like this exists, but they should make a movie about 19th century European warfare where the various heads of state actually look and speak like they come from the places that they do. Everyone here was just way too British. I left with the impression that Napoleon was probably pretty strange but in a different way from how the film depicted it; this felt like Joaquin Phoenix's brand of stange. I did, however, appreciate the general vibe of how all the Great Men of History were just weird dudes—that felt correct to me.<p>The line about boats brought the house* down.<p>*My five friends and no one else

Rattled the parents a little with this one but life is about taking risks.<p>Once I got past my dad's initial reaction ("I didn't care for it at all"), I got to hear about the parts of the film he did like, including: the costumes, the music, Emma Stone's acting, Rachel Weisz's acting, Olivia Coleman's acting (very different from The Crown!), that the central dynamic very casually featured no men, and that it was occasionally funny. <p>My mom said it was "definitely not a mainstream movie" but she was glad we watched it.<p>Of course, my entire family will watch Emma Stone do pretty much anything.

Bank robbery turned hostage standoff is one of the few scenarios in movie logic where, as in real life, you are completely fucked. You are not getting out there. You are not getting on that jet. So to start from that position, and then make the character progressively more sympathetic (give or take a few alleged guns to the head), is a pretty cruel thing to do. And yet!<p>Good film; sad film. Watched it with my parents, and right before Sonny's call with Leon my dad says "this phone call is some of the best acting you're ever going to see," which was right, of course. Both calls are heartbreaking in their own way, and they're scripted so beautifully that every word provides you with more insight into their dynamic, but no simple judgement on it.<p>There are many terrific touches but dynamic between the media, the cops, and especially the crowd is one of my favorites<p>It's been building for a while, but I have formally decided that I'm an Al Pacino guy.

I will never write a review of any film that beats The Onion's: "‘Phantom Thread’ Wins Academy Award For Best Film You Liked But Probably Wouldn’t See Again"<p>I know this was good. The score is fantastic, the sets are immaculate, and Daniel-Day Lewis looks like he brought fourth some new veins on his forehead just so that they could be constantly threatening to burst. But this just isn't my thing.<p>I feel like all stories of people who pursue a craft with such dedication that they're completely intolerable in all other respects are roughly the same: they focus, they briefly crack and reveal some yawning void in their psyche, and then they focus up again. It's <em>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</em>. It's <em>Free Solo</em>. And I like sushi and mountains much more than mid-century British dresses.<p>I'm also either too young or too normal to relate to whatever is going on in the last 30 minutes of this film. There's a shocking number of "she's so me fr" reviews and I very kindly urge those people to seek professional counseling.

According to Wikipedia, the police consultants on this move were bothered that Gene Hackman's "Popeye" Doyle shot the suspect in the back, because that's murder. Friedkin defended this choice by saying that's exactly what Eddie Egan, the cop on whom Doyle is based, would have done. Lest you misinterpret this statement, Eddie Egan not only consulted on the film, he has a relatively significant speaking role as Doyle's boss.<p>Gene Hackman's performance in this film has so much momentum that by the time you get to the car chase sequence it almost feels like the subway is trying to keep up with <em>him</em>. I seem to be watching a lot of cop movies lately and they usually sort well into either "cop who is haggard and world-weary" and "cop who is a complete maniac." This one is very easy to categorize.

For the first 30 minutes I was mildly interested in what I expected to be a sort of South American <em>Casablanca</em> and was rewarded with electrifying clarity when the plot snapped into place.<p>Grim, gorgeous, and riveting, <em>Sorcerer</em> is one of those cipher movies that can be about whatever you want. They're pawns of imperial capital; they're stateless persons with no papers or rights; they're greedy bastards risking their lives on a score; they're damned souls driving of their own ferry straight into Hades.<p>The rope bridge scene provokes the rare horror of being far too convincing, where you leave with absolute certainly that it took place in real life.

Good but disorienting in the way that I assume watching a live-action anime adaptation would be (I have never subjected myself to this, personally). There is so much Evangelion DNA here—down to the way that they sync their brains to pilot a giant fighting machine and their suits fill with an orange fluid—that it's impossible not to miss some of aesthetic and emotional affordances that animation provides.<p>GDT is the master of bringing fantastic beings into meatspace, and the over-engineered hydraulic interior of mech cockpit is the closest he gets to capturing the physicality of these insanely huge objects; it feels harsh and unwieldy in a way that I think would actually be very hard to capture with animation. The gooey world of alien brains and toenails that Charlie Day's character is playing around in is also a lot of fun. It all gets much less convincing (and compelling) when the giant CGI robots are fighting the giant CGI aliens, which, unsurprisingly, gets a lot of screen time.<p>There is a ton of power to the premise that humans are way way out of their depth, and <em>Pacific Rim</em> commits to that, until it doesn't. The 2014 <em>Godzilla</em> (sorry) gets this right by just not showing the full monsters most of the time, allowing the fragile-looking humans to scramble around ineffectually underfoot. But the 2014 <em>Godzilla</em> is probably the best American cinema will ever do with the monster movie concept. I think I should watch more monster movies.<p>I did nonetheless have a lot of fun watching this and I cared when various people died which was impressive given that my friends who've seen this movie (up to 8 times?? in theaters???) kept talking over key dialogue.

Which it isn't.<p>Can liberalism ever win? Or did liberalism already win and all that's left is to grind out the small victories, at increasing difficulty and cost?<p>The real Serpico came back from Switzerland and now lives in a small house upstate.

Also, even in 2023, it's very rare I watch a movie that so prominently features homosexuality where homosexuality has almost nothing to do with the plot.

The twists that hit the hardest are the ones where you were being told the truth the entire time. There isn't a magical moment with her mom in the ever-after, because she died in the earthquake. The moment in the ever-after is about a four year-old accepting that and learning to keep living with it. Brutal stuff. <p>Loved the chair, loved when they went on their little roadtrip, loved the Neir Automata music when they're pushing the doors closed. The movie is kind of messy but it's very sincere.

Not enough people know that this movie was financed by financial fraud. The $150 million budget was financed by a studio called Red Granite Pictures, one of projects that came out of the <em>billion</em> dollars stolen from the  Government of Malaysia via the 1MDB fund. In his Golden Globes speech, DiCaprio thanks a man named Jho Low, who is currently an international fugitive, and the studio is insolvent after paying a $60 million fine. For this reason, the United States Government owns the rights to <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, among other assets seized.<p>Scorsese famously wanted to crash a real Lamborghini for this movie, and he did—courtesy of the citizens of Malaysia (I learned all this from a fun book my mom got me for Christmas called <em>The Billion Dollar Whale</em>).<p>I fall hard on the permissive side of the insufferable "can you make good movies about bad people" conversation because, well, of course you can. But this movie is just shockingly uninteresting. I thought the <em>The Departed</em> was a lesser Scorsese but at least that was exciting; I did not find it exciting to watch rich guys do hookers and blow for 3 hours. I'm really not trying to be contrarian: this movie is so lame?<p>DiCaprio is pretty good in the second half, but he's a great actor and he's as good or better in half a dozen other films. The cinematography is uninspired, the CGI is bizarre, and the <em>editing</em> of all things is uncharacteristically choppy. The only fun Scorsese shot to be had is when Belfort is on premium vintage quaaludes  and he thinks there's more stairs than there are. Woooowwww. More stairs. (I did like that sequence). <p>I think Scorsese felt that the balance of goodtimes vs comeuppance was a little off here and his band-aid was just to make the FBI agent real fuckin sexy.<p>But it's not hard to imagine what happened here. Why be creative when you have no constraints? Just... do all the stuff Belfort did. It's hard to say anything interesting about a guy who buys a Lamborghini and crashes it when you are also a guy who buys a Lamborghini and crashes it. Scorsese didn't know all the money was stolen but he should have known to have a little taste.<p>You know who did though? Jordan Belfort, who walked into the film's egregious wrap party, looked around, and said "no one spends money like this when they earned it."<p>(Give <em>Billion Dollar Whale</em> a read, it's quite good).

Have talked the ears off all my friends about Pride & Prejudice after reading the book for the first time, and am thrilled to learn what I've been missing out on.<p>I enjoyed this but I don't think it really stands on it own. Most of the moments that are funny are funny because I have a lot of extra context the (very funny) book provides, and the interpretation is occasionally so literal that it feels like they're hitting marks instead of telling a story.<p>Darcy is difficult to portray because his character arc is so drastic; Macfadyen plays it like his problem is that he's basically super shy which I don't think quite captures it. I do think he and Keira Knightly were both at their best in the big dramatic scenes. My sister says he's the worst Darcy so I'll be reporting back about Colin Firth (though not on Letterboxd, due to my strict stance that a miniseries is not a movie; some of you people were rating <em>Wandavision</em> on here and we've got to draw the line somewhere).

This lacks a lot of the things you might find in a "good" movie (character development, plot, pacing, a compelling message, consistent writing) but it's an entertaining talent showcase and now you can say you've seen it and maybe get a difficult pub trivia question in 20 years. <p>In some ways it's not fair to compare this to a bunch of famous teen comedies with A-list celebrities (and SNL people) but idk this is the movie reviews website where you review movies. <em>Heathers</em> is honestly not that much funnier than this, but much more confident in its politics, costumes, and murders, so the irony lands better. <em>Superbad</em> is also a movie about some losers trying to get laid, but it <em>is</em> much funnier. <em>Bottoms</em> is most similar to <em>Booksmart</em>, but even if you thought <em>Booksmart</em> was insufferable (I liked it, but I understand), it also had two compelling female leads and lesbian romance—in addition to bunch of the "good" movie things mentioned above.<p>During the first scene I felt like my dad watching <em>Juno</em>, who came home from the theater so incensed that "nobody actually talks like that" that he brought it up multiple times over the following few days. That comparison a little terrifying for me, I'll admit.<p>You already know Ayo Edebiri is a star, and she benefits from being the only character with something approaching a story arc; Ruby Cruz is going to demolish a lead role in like 2 years and I'll be saying "I told you so" forever after that.<p>Alright last edit: this movie doesn't commit nearly enough to the surreality of high school but you know what would? A gritty Ned's Declassified reboot. Okay I'm done now.

All space movies are <em>2001, A Space Odyssey</em>, this one more than most.<p>If you did not watch this when it came out you have no idea how rattling it was to see Matt Damon pop out of that bathtub at the hour-thirty mark. "Dr Mann... he was the best of us" and it's weepy Matt Damon, who was not promoted in the film's marketing and did not appear in its trailers. This is so disorienting that you really haven't gained your bearings before Mann pushes Coop off that cliff.<p>Mentioned in my <em>Inception</em> review that Nolan does not get enough credit for his casting because he makes it look easy. McConaughey had a little bit of dramatic cred by this time, but it was still a pretty big swing to imagine the <em>How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em> lead as cinema's greatest Girl Dad. Christian Bale could not have pulled off the voicemails scene.<p>Nolan's infamous literalism reaches new heights here; he was born to make a movie where the future is full of rust and dust. Oh you thought it was lame that the dream movie was mostly tall buildings? Well we're going to go to the farthest reaches of the universe and the two big ideas for the planets are "lots of water" and "lots of ice." We're going to hire a bunch of physicists to do groundbreaking black hole visualizations. And it will all be breathtakingly gorgeous.<p>I was pretty cynical about the "love is the answer" ending when I was in high school, because I thought it was very stupid. But now I cry multiple times watching this, starting about 20 minutes in. Maybe love really is the answer. Maybe the most important job in the universe is being a Girl Dad.

Ages ago I read an AV Club <a href="https://www.avclub.com/explore-the-wild-world-of-futurama-in-just-10-episodes-1798239915">introduction to <em>Futurama</em></a> had this to say about the show:<p><blockquote>
Fry’s lonely everyguy quality is a soft spot at the center of the show, making it more of a joke machine and throwing emphasis on the nature of the show’s humor, which, in the words of Frank Lovece, is in the “distinctly rueful” Jewish tradition, compared to the more hopeful “American-Irish vaudeville humor” that he detects in The Simpsons. Lovece also quotes cartoon historian Jerry Beck, who once ranked the show as his favorite animated TV series of all time, right behind Ren And Stimpy and The Simpsons, as saying that “The Simpsons has an identifiable family in an identifiable world with everything regular people go through.
</blockquote><p>This movie, despite its intensely put-upon humor, has a distinctly hopeful note that I found very charming. It's very amusing, and the title only gets funnier as the movie goes on.

Excruciating watch. I yelled "no don't do it!" and then shielded my eyes with a pillow when she went back up to give another speech at the first reception. It didn't get much easier after that.<p>I know this is barely a romantic comedy but the writing lets her romance with Officer Rhodes breathe in a way that almost seems like it's from an entirely different movie. Which it sort of is—Lillian is already living a Chicago life, most of the comedy derives from how Annie feels trying to keep up with that milieu. I would definitely have watched the version of this that's just a Milwaukee romcom. I'm a sucker for any setting where The Big City is Chicago.<p>I thought basically everything Melissa McCarthy did was hysterical, but the air marshal bit is inspired. Also the cop jokes are about as anti-cop as you can be more in broad studio comedy where the romantic lead is a cop.<p>My final observation is that Kristen Wiig, a very pretty person anyway, is especially attractive as Annie. Just a smoking hot disaster of a woman. If I had a therapist, I'd probably talk to them about that.

Here's the wild ones 🤪<p>Had a <em>Death of Stalin</em> experience where most of the time I'm doing kind of an exhale-chuckle and then they catch me completely off guard with "it's more tasteful than it sounds" and I absolutely lose it. Suffers a little from how dated the tropes that its parodying are, but the costumes are so immaculate and the plot is so bonkers that it almost achieves some timelessness that the genre doesn't really deserve.<p>A little detail I liked is that we meet Veronica 2/3 of the way through the traditional naive -> cool -> genuine girl arc of these films, so that she's extremely sexually confident the entire time and we aren't doing a hacky parody of her self-discovery journey. It's a little bit of a problem that the plot doesn't really have a replacement arc for Veronica, but "it's bad to murder your classmates and bomb a school" is a decent lesson to learn I guess.<p>Restocked my mineral water this weekend.

Inception has a strange legacy. A massive original blockbuster that grossed almost a billion dollars, infected a decade of trailers with the BWAM sound, took home four Oscars, and is widely remembered as... great, but also a little bad?<p>As a culture, one of the mistakes we made with <em>Inception</em> was trying too hard to explain it. Christopher Nolan's algebraic style lends itself to this misinterpretation—David Lynch jumpscares you with a spooky guy in a dumpster and you think "oh there's some grainy emotional truth to this," but, in this movie especially, Nolan can't help explaining so much that you're left with the feeling that if you just sat down with a pen and paper you could come up with a solution to who's where and and when. He actually nailed this trick once (<em>The Prestige</em>, his best script), but it wasn't until <em>Interstellar</em> that he made a movie so nakedly emotional that enough people said "ah, there's some grainy emotional truth to this" and accepted that you weren't supposed to solve it mathematically.<p>I love this movie. It is not particularly highbrow: it's heist film led by the biggest movie star in the world whose character feels responsible for his wife's death, and we go deeper and deeper into his subconscious until he has to confront his guilt. It's the meatiest role that Nolan has ever written for a woman (really low bar, but still), and Cotillard eats the hell out of it so that the final montage of their life in limbo lands. <p>This is not remembered as an Acting movie—nor is Nolan usually considered an Acting director—but I think that's mostly because Nolan's taste in actors is fabulous, and he has the cachet to get people in roles that are effortless for them. This is a fastball for Leo, prime Tumblr era for JGL, a climax that absolutely does not work without Cillian Murphy, the biggest leading role for Elliot page, and America's introduction to the comically charming Tom Hardy. No one fails to take the ridiculously expository dialogue seriously, which means that when it comes time to deliver the actual heaters—"you're the best I can do; but I'm sorry, you're just not good enough"—there is not a shred of irony to ruin to moment.<p><i>no. no no no. I was disappointed... that you tried.</i><p>What you have to understand is that Chris Nolan is a director for goddamn cornballs.

The famous regional accents—which everyone thinks are a bit much until they actually visit rural Minnesota—mask how generically American the setting is. There's bars and hotels and a big city nearby and a couple random houses and mostly you gotta drive around on highways a lot to get anywhere. The snow foregrounds the blood and headlights but this movie could have taken place in Connecticut and it would have been otherwise identical. If I were asked to share a foreign film that captures what it's like to be from my country, I'd pick this one. <p>There's good people and there's bad people; there's weak people and there's stubborn people; there's people who will hire strange men to kidnap their wife and there's people who want to get their painting of a mallard on a postage stamp—it's a struggle to hold all them in your head at the same time, but we just gotta try.

I think the point of the third act, especially its gutting conclusion between Oppenheimer and Einstein, is to contrast the pettiness of American politics with the almighty power that Oppenheimer granted it.<p>Another hit single from the Taylor Swift of movies, <em>Oppenheimer</em> rocks and rolls through the biopic formula, demonstrating the lessons Nolan has learned (exposition is mostly inferred, he doesn't keep checking in to see if you're keeping up) and the lessons he hasn't (how to write a woman). <p>The scene that reveals where all the stomping comes from is petrifying. Everyone who told me you don't really need to see it in IMAX was wrong—being blasted by sound and light during some random conversation he's having is crucial. I fear the rewatch value on this one is going to be low, for this and other reasons.

Most people can be categorized by whether they're rooting for Sergeant Howie or the islanders and, regrettably, I am a Sergeant man. I find his conviction inspiring, even as his circumstances deteriorate into a hell he's incapable of comprehending. The movie is unequivocal that his beliefs are the cause of his eventual immolation, but, also, isn't that what Christianity is about?<p>Ah well, another blow for my faith in modernity and humanity's collective attempt to organize itself above its basest impulses; those impulses seem like a lot of fun.

Margot Robbie crushes what should be an impossible role. Barbie—a synecdoche for the impossible standards to which we hold women and our patchy attempts to change that—is <em>relatable</em>. You root for Barbie when she's at her most oblivious, and you believe in her fundamental Barbie-ness when she's at her most despondent. She carries the film and catapults it though the strange, moving conclusion. Only a true movie star could make that happen.<p>Thankfully, the movie is also quite funny. Like <em>The Lego Movie</em> before it, <em>Barbie</em> mines a ton of humor from its toy-ness, from sight gags where Barbies twist like toys to dropping marketing slogans as one-liners ("All Ken's clothes fit me too!"). Visually super all around, and lots of fun.<p>Message-wise, Robbie lands the plane without a lot of help. After a very sweet reveal that Barbie was brought here by Gloria, not Sasha, the mother-daughter relationship is fixed up more or less instantly, which really robs the movie of some stakes. Gosling's superb Ken takes over as the main villain and it's fine. It's all pretty funny and the dance numbers are immaculate but the third act is a somewhat obvious wind-down after a second act full of interesting misdirections.<p>The contrasting montages where Ken discovers patriarchy and Barbie discovers melancholy were sublime.

This has weirdly good ingredients—the visuals are unique, the West is an eternally good setting, and the voice acting is pretty decent. But the Dreamworks-style plot is far too thin to make anything of it, and the children's-movie-not-really rude humor of 2011 has aged terribly. Baffling yet understandable product of its time.

I'm not the most objective person to review the Caro/Gottlieb documentary because these books have had a big impact on me, but I'm sure the same is true for most people who make the time to watch this. <p><em>Turn Every Page</em> is charming and fun, as both men are sufficiently quirky characters to keep the 2-hour runtime entertaining. Caro's stunning reporting stories are familiar to readers of his work, but Gottleib's anecdotes from being at the center of New York publishing are also impressive.<p>Where this documentary really hits, though, is when the two men consider their relationship to the body of work that they are both going to be remembered for. Robert Gottleib—whose other editing credits include the works Toni Morrison and Jospeh Hell—has a far more genial demeanor about it. Though his commentary is bittersweet in light of his passing less than a year after the documentary's release, Gottleib is unmistakably at peace, as much as any of us can be, with the life he lived, filled as it was with books and ballet.<p>Not so for Robert Caro, who has devoted most of his entire adult life to chronicling the life of one man and has not finished. Caro, who has endured a decade of jokes about his ability to finish this series and his reluctance to comment on it, ever so slightly loses his composure in response to an unheard, but easily inferred question from the documentarian—"you're asking me if I'm going to die. I don't think it's helpful for me to consider that." The anguish is palpable, as is my sudden guilt for having contributed, spiritually, to his distress. He reminds the viewer that he could leave things out and hurry the job—and no one would know what he left out!—but that's not the book you want to read; it's certainly not the book he wants to write.<p>Like Caro, I too believe he's going to finish his masterwork. What good does it do either of us to think otherwise?

My favorite Ghibli. It begins with a horrifying demon animal who meets Ashitaka's funeral blessing with a defiant curse, and never relents in its spite. Everyone is angry; everyone is afraid.<p>Neil Gaiman was partially responsible for the English translation of this film, which is interesting because one of its central plot devices—the old, intelligent gods of the forest assembling for a doomed charge against the new gods of modernity—is the premise of his most famous novel, which came out four years later. This premise is also dark as hell. The old boar Okkoto, draped in the demon curse, rampaging back to the lake with Mononoke clinging to his snout, is a truly dreadful image.<p>A vivid encounter with the sublime where—like in Coleridge's <em>Rime of Ancient Mariner</em>—humanity's hubris is not ignored by an indifferent natural world, but amplified by it with unpredictable, unintelligible consequences.

Wes Anderson films can reliably be described as having "a cast of characters" but this one forefronts each of them with economy and balance that even the <em>The French Dispatch</em> (a film I might have been a little too kind to at the time) vignette formula fails to do.<p>Walking out of the theater I said it was about "grief" but it might be about "life" or also "ennui"—which is the kind of thing that a playwright might mean when he says "infinity." Really it's a framing device to give you a chance to find the humanity that resonates with you from all these little fellows, each of whom is precisely complex enough to keep the caricature from being a sufficient description. "Overeager actor" or "late bloomer boy" or "frustrated starlet" or "adorable triplet girls who just lost their mother" don't really capture what's precious about each of their arclets. <p>The first of two films this summer that prominently feature the original sin of nuclear weapons, 1950's America is the perfect setting for a story where everyone feels slightly uncomfortable in their skin but isn't able to put to words the reason why.<p>The ending is phenomenal and leaves you with some hope that even if they never find peace, they're going to keep giving it a try.

Very important to this film that there is a real undercurrent of love. Mother-daughter stories especially hinge on this, and you get just enough warmth from the mother to understand all the stress. The relationship between the two girls also ends on a crucially (for me, a sap) sweet note—I think Molly Gordon carries their chemistry a little bit, but in Rachel Sennott's defense, her character has a lot on her mind.<p>I like seeing emotional journeys reflected in costuming, especially when the subject can't change their clothes. Danielle spills coffee on half her shirt, and then she's just walking around with half a coffee shirt for the rest of the film.<p>Diana Argon excels at radiating a kind of frustrated sadness while never once changing her facial expressions. As if there's a million things she wants to say but she can't because she's somehow trapped inside the body of the prettiest person you've ever seen.<p>I thought this was a great watch at a tight 90 minutes with a few laugh-out-loud moments. Fun for the whole family!

Amazing vibe. The symmetrical sets create an Art Deco Wes Anderson space that suggests the machinery of corporate America is functionally infinite—like when you pull two mirrors together in a dressing room, the desks or the boardroom continue on forever. It reminded me of the Series of Unfortunate Events Netflix show, where they designed the bank to look like "what a kid thinks a bank looks like." Often very funny too, with the right number of recurring bits and the right attitude of general dark whimsy. Evil Paul Newman saying "plexiglass" is an amazing line delivery. And you know... for kids.<p>I just did not quite love the <em>movie</em> that much, because while it's a great satire of the aesthetic of corporate America I didn't find it to be a particular insightful satire of its functions. Reasonable people could (and do) disagree, but with the exception of the opening scene, it felt like this movie wanted to say something about what your brain on capitalism is like and that message didn't really click for me. <p>Also JJL's character being at all hurt by Norville's misogynistic speculation felt a little contrived? Like why would she care what he thinks?

It feels mildly perverse to watch someone tell you this much about themself. Stop! Please! I'm uncomfortable.<p>That aspect of Woody Allen's style is one of the many reasons <em>Annie Hall</em> feels so modern. Our era both demands confessionals and delivers viscous judgement upon them—and there's plenty to judge here. In a way, it's comforting to know that the fantasy of meeting a mildly quirky yet insanely beautiful woman by happenstance stretches back well before the premier of <em>New Girl</em>. I relate to both Alvy and Annie actually. There, now you know something about me too.<p>I find it likewise revealing that Allen is plainly aware that he does not write women whose intellect he respects and yet... still doesn't write them.<p>It's a terrific movie though, full of playful touches like the subtitles or elementary school classroom, and painfully real moments like Alvy trying to recreate the lobster date or Annie calling him over because there's a spider. Or even realizing you're a temperamentally East Coast guy dating a temperamentally West Coast girl. That one hasn't happened to me, but it's plausible. <p>It's a fantasy. We all have them.

Had a moment of dread when the film started and I realized that there was going to be no sound at all for the entire two hour runtime. Alex old boy, you've flown a little too close to the sun on this film kick of yours.<p>I ended up having a pretty pleasant time watching this and squinting at the libretto—provided on paper in a pitch-dark theater. It's a story about a farming community coming together to industrialize on their own terms, to advance forward in time. Like a converse <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, where instead of one man building an empire and losing his soul, a town of peasants build a collective and find theirs. Americans have a political habit of romanticizing farm life and I do not think that anyone East of Germany does this. Like the pages of "The Path to Power" where Robert Caro describes the impact of rural electrification, <em>The General Line</em> makes it abundantly clear that living as a rural peasant in the 1900s was far closer to the Middle Ages than the Industrial Revolution.<p>Sincerely my favorite part was when the peasants bought their first bull, watched it grow up, and then held a wedding for it and the cow. They decorated them both with flowers and let them wander the pasture together. Not only was this beautiful, but it ended with a cinematic metaphor for the two cows having sex that was so funny that I unsettled the otherwise crypt-quiet theater with laughter for a full 15 seconds.<p>You should not rush out to the theater to see <em>Old and New</em> (as it was billed at Anthology), but if you ever have a friend suggest some weird movies to see and one of them is a Soviet silent film, say yes! You'll get <em>something</em> out of it.

You know how you can watch an amazing ice skating routine but then they do something that's illegal and it caps their score? That's sort of how I feel about this movie (also I don't know anything about ice skating).<p>I think it's possible that I could love a movie that's half of a two-parter, but the story told just in that movie would have to feel complete, and I'm sorry, this one does not. It would have worked if the they had leaned into the Gwen Stacy arc a little more—in particular I wanted more about her relationship with her dad. Then the movie could have been one complete story about Gwen, and a multipart story about Miles. I got the impression they were reaching for that, but just did not fully commit.<p>This is extra frustrating because every scene in Gwen world is like nothing you've ever seen on film. Good lord is it beautiful. The shifting backgrounds and colors are pretty high concept but it's also crystal clear how they reflect the emotions of the people in the scene. It's wild and wonderful and I could live inside it.<p>All the art is completely in a class of its own, and not just because it's insanely pretty, but because of how well it augments character beats. Hobie is very funny, strikingly animated, and has a spider-gimmick that, in a clever misdirection, ends up being relevant to the plot. I also loved Spot, whose initially grating patter becomes sad, then endearing, and then <em>terrifying</em>. The moment where he walks into the void and becomes a screen-filling Doug Rattman drawing gave me chills.<p>I don't have nearly as much to say about the Miles story. The idea that all the different spider-people share a trauma is interesting, but I think somewhat undercut by Miles' arc being about rejecting that premise because his (second one?) has not happened yet. Which is obviously how a normal person should react to that! <p>It's not like this particular franchise had much of a choice, but every time we drag a bucket up from the multiverse well it becomes harder and harder to dredge something novel from it. The first Spider-Verse movie was probably the apex of it, but I'm not sure that anything is going to top Evelyn Wang getting back from her other bodies and going "I have to tell my husband how successful I would have been without him!"<p>This creative team is one of my favorite on the planet and with this movie they continue to set an example for the rest of the industry. This franchise concept might be close to tapped out in every universe though—guess we'll find out in Part 2!

This is a good time movie—when you watch it you have a good time. The script robbed Vincent D'Onofrio. He's very funny anyway but if he'd been written with just a little more depth this would be an iconic performance at the level of Defoe's Green Gobin. I remember watching his first scene on a silent television at the rec center when I was a kid and thinking "yikes maybe I'll wait a few years on that one." I was pretty little but frankly not little enough to have that reaction.

There's a scene in the television show where Bobby Briggs loses it at Laura's funeral. "Everybody knew she was in trouble," he screams, "but we didn't do anything. All you good people. You wanna know who killed Laura? You did! We all did." Watching this movie somehow makes you feel complicit. Like Bobby is yelling at you too.<p>Sheryl Lee was so good at being in flashbacks that David Lynch invented the role of Maddy Ferguson (Laura's cousin) so that she could have more screen time in the television show. She gets two hours to be Laura Palmer here, a performance so breathaking it single-handedly justifies the existence of the film. <em>"So you want to fuck the homecoming queen.</em>" she snarls at two paying suitors in a venomous indictment of them, the viewer, and possibly David Lynch. Well, she's going to give you what you want. Are you happy now?<p>Having a hard time writing about any of the Leland Palmer scenes. I respect the choice to depict—unflinchingly—what it felt like to be in that house. And to face fully the horror of what Twin Peaks the show was about by making Bob a more obvious metaphor for how a child would process parental sexual abuse. But what a wretched thing to watch, my God.

What a treasure.<p>On this second time through I was taken with how gradually the momentum builds and the illusion falls away. Naomi Watts' schlockey naivete as first-hour Betty does a subtle but noticeable transition when they break into Diane's apartment. She's more confident, more cunning, and about to be confronted with the first deeply disquieting reminder that she's inside what might be called a dream. Her official transition into Diane feels like a switch flip the first time you watch it, but only because you were part of the fantasy.<p>The reintroduction of of Camilla's (and actress Laura Harring's) identity as a Hispanic woman, beginning with her whispering "silencio" in bed, the first time we hear her speak Spanish, is also pivotal to the fantasy breaking down. By the end of the film she's a fully realized person, who neither acts not dresses nor sounds like Diane, and the contrast highlights just how thin Diane's conception of her really was. The reverse shots of the two women gripping each other as their identities violently reassert themselves is goddamn devastating, even (especially?) when, like Betty and Rita, you don't really know what's happening.<p>But crucially for this film to work, Lynch does eventually tell you, or at least tell you enough to leave satisfied. For all his vaunted ambiguity, he can't resist telling you how clever he is, and then reminding you that you still haven't learned your lesson—not when Betty nails her audition, not when Betty locks eyes with Adam, not when the trumpet keeps playing, and not when La Llorona collapses on the stage. Well, he earned it. And I'm going to keep forgetting that lesson.<p>Because life wouldn't be bearable—and movies wouldn't be fun—if you weren't capable of a little make-believe.<p><em>Those are all of sixteen reasons why I... love... you.</em>

As a late 90s child, discovering the appeal of Schwarzenegger the actor is a really funny experience because here's this quasi-mythic figure—Olympian in stature, achievements, and personal troubles—and he just loves being a silly goofy guy. He has an "aw shucks" charm as Quaid that never feels insincere even though he looks like that.<p>I think the reason he's so good at one-liners is that he never sounds like he's trying to be tough. When people quote "consider that a divorce" they usually do like a serious Terminator voice but Arnold is totally silly with it. I laughed for a solid minute when threw out "See you at the party Richter!" holding two disembodied arms and it honestly made me regret watching this movie alone. <p>Verhoeven is reliably great. I don't think the setting is nearly as sharp as <em>Robocop</em>'s but he's much better at gritty capitalist future than basically anyone else. Lesser directors might do a scene where someone can't get surgery because they don't have enough credits—Verhoeven skips right past that to "bad air grows psychic space voldemort on your chest." Gross and cool.

The biggest achievement of this film is that it never lets you settle into one of its modes. Its earlier scenes have deliberate delineations between the high school conflict straight out of <em>Grease</em> and the seedy noir, but those barriers do not hold, and by the end, the tone is changing so fast it's downright twitchty. The woman dancing on the car is really funny; that scene is not.<p>I suppose this isn't supposed to be subtle but I thought the class distinctions were done well. Jeffrey as a striving working-to-middle class kid is nicely observed. You can almost see the character of Laura Palmer forming as the film explores the idea that the worlds Jeffrey steps in and out of aren't really separate, but superimposed.<p>My friend Parker noted that David Lynch is a fundamentally campy director, and I agree with that. He's so excited to put those goofy kids in a diner and have someone cry to a song that he probably associates with a devastating memory from the 60s.<p>I'm afraid, despite cringing from revulsion thirty percent of the time, that I quite liked it.<p><em>♪ Bluuueeeeeee Velvet ♪</em>

Director Matt Johnson did a Q&A at IFC after—which spilled out to him just hanging out on 6th Ave—that clarified a lot of things I felt watching this movie. None of these quotes are literally accurate (do you think I'm the kind of guy who brings a notebook to movies?) but they are vibrationally accurate, like the film.<p>On copyright: "I specifically tried to violate as many people's copyright as possible. It sucks when you're watching a movie and they're using like a fake version of cheerios. I don't want aliens to watch our movies after we're gone and think we sucked."<p>On tech nostalgia: "I don't care about any of that stuff. I just wanted to show the things those guys would actually have been into so it feels real." He then did a bit about your grandfather showing you a gameboy that was too funny for me try and transcribe.<p>On Canadians: "We're a very conservative country with not a lot of ambition."<p>On Jim Balsillie: "That guy did everything right. They were going nowhere without him. He out-Americaned the Americans." (ed. note: this character is portrayed committing multi-million dollar stock fraud)<p>On other similar projects about 90s properties: Everyone repeating these quotes on Letterboxd is a narc.<p>Anyway, an unconventional filmmaker who deliberately sets out to make a very conventional biopic produced exactly that! But it's better than than it should be because Johnson directs it with a deliberately amoral and aromatic lens. He's kind of just curious about these guys, and what their story has to say about work, innovation, society, and Canada.<p>Glenn Howerton is 80% of the way there. He needs a bit of polish but he should absolutely keep doing whatever he's doing here.

Rosamund Pike's career-defining performance is still incredible. The "cool girl" monologue sounds a bit dated now but the feelings behind it are as raw as ever.<p>But, I also think that this is Ben Affleck's best performance and definitely his most underappreciated. It's incredibly important to this movie that Nick is a really shitty dude but <i>not so shitty that he deserves to be framed for murder</i>. Affleck needs to sell you on the "normal" reaction to the person that Amy decides to become. At the end, he's a guy who just wants to stop hurting, trapped with a woman who's decided that she's beyond hurt.<p>Tyler Perry helps with this too—a great just-light-enough character that keeps you from drowning in psychopathy. He's so charming and his suits are immaculate.<p>One more thing about Pike: the best part of her performance is in the middle, where Amy is a little less guarded and a little out of her depth. Based on her subsequent roles, I don't think that the casting agents who saw this really understood it. After watching her lay a terrifying trap, it is incredibly satisfying to see Amy contend with the limits of her perspective. She can't possibly relate to the woman next door, and she gets sniffed out as a phony immediately. She's also so funny! I especially love her reaction to the TV hits. "The girl with the cum-on-me tits now dressed like a fucking mennonite" is a hall of fame line delivery.

David Lynch understands that no one is more sensitive to leylines of American culture, no one teetering more precipitously between elegiac bliss and psychic obliteration, than unbelievably hot women.<p>Watching a lot of movies lately that play with the expectations evoked by nostalgia and the "16 Reasons" shot tells you that it's fake in 3 different ways before hitting you with a zoom so effective you instantly believe what it's selling. Ugh.

I'm glad I watched a couple other Wes Andersons before seeing this one, because a lot of people describe <i>Grand Budapest</i> as the most Wes Anderson, but I actually think the moments when the affect drops, only briefly, like when Gustav is angry about the treatment of Zero on the train, are some of the most moving a West Aanderson film has ever been for me.<p>This story is beautiful all the way through.

This movie nails a really tough shot by showing how horrific it is to have a RoboCop while making RoboCop himself really sympathetic. RoboCop is also funny as hell. RoboCop: drops a perfect one-liner an hour into the group bar hang and says nothing the rest of the night.<p>I adore every "fun" directorial choice here, especially as it relates to the aesthetics of television media. The scene-setting newscasters and TV ads, "I'd buy THAT for a dollar," the RoboCop POV shots that feel like you're looking OUT through a television—rad. I'm frankly kind of squeamish but I know quality gore when I see it. The goo sludge he eats seems like it's going to be a relevant plot point and is instead just a tremendous sight gag.<p>RoboCop's introduction and his actual abilities are eerily identical to MCU Iron Man, if you take away all the nationalist polish. It also has a lot of similarities to a Doctor Who Cybermen story. Guy who should have died but is now trapped inside a robot is a really good sci-fi idea that always makes me sad.<p>My mom, a real '80s head, laughed when I told her I watched RoboCop. "Everyone's seen RoboCop!" I think it's nice that a movie like this can have that kind of broad cultural cache, and I'm hopeful that the 2020s might see more of that after last decade's minor dead zone. She did confuse some of the plot points with Terminator 2 though.

Take my opinion with a grain of salt because it's filmed at my high school (which my high school is NOT proud of), but this movie absolutely nails the vibe of what white South Florida is like. Wealthy enclaves with spacious lots ensconced by palm trees, single-story homes that middle class people bought in the '90s, and miles upon miles of strip mall frosted glass straw hat sleaze. Everything is just a little extra: extra hot, extra crazy.<p>I probably would have hated this if I hadn't seen it in theaters, but the 35mm projection and the audience reactions made it a fun time at the movies. The woke moralists at IFC censored the pool scene.

Possibly the worst police work I've ever seen on film. I don't know that warrants have ever been an issue in an active hostage situations? The evilest sicko alive just runs away on foot a bunch? Everyone, including Harry, is insanely lackadaisical about solving this case, but to be fair, it's hard for us on the East Coast to really understand how slow everyone out there moves.<p>Damn shame that this has all the aesthetic ingredients to be a tremendous noir but it has no interest in its characters (except to remind you they suck) or the city it's set in (except to remind you that it sucks, and is gay), and you need to care about at least one of those to make a noir. Football field, Jesus Saves, Golden Gate Bridge, all wasted.<p>More than willing—eager even—to put aside my politics for a movie but it's gotta be a better movie than this.<p>One time Harry yells "beat it fatso" at his partner for absolutely no reason.

This is a barely dressed-up play but that works for me as long as you dress it up with some artful lighting and atmospheric shots of the mountains of Montana, the plains of Ireland, or the streets of Sheepshead Bay.<p>The elevated subway going by during key dialogue moments is a constant reminder that we're not dealing with the best of the best here. Pacino's performance perfectly captures this—the top dog among real estate salesman who work walking distance from Coney Island. I love how the script plays with the audience's attempt to figure out exactly what scams are going on here, like when you realize why Roma set a date for Monday.<p>Consequences are different for everyone. Roma will probably lose his chance at a Cadillac, Moss will probably lose his job, and Levene will probably go to jail and his daughter will die(?). Tremendous cast but Jack Lemmon is so pathetic and sad and wet here that I found this film physically painful to watch.<p>If you don't like movies about Men Talking you might want to skip this.

Fun movie that reminded me of rewatching <em>It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World</em>. Stunning performance from Charles Groden, who humanizes De Niro by annoying the shit out of him while effortlessly dropping many of the funniest moments in the film.<p>Each side character has their own flavor of physical comedy, and I liked that Walsh had a different signature bit he did with everyone.<p>Saw this at a hosted IFC show with a sold-out crowd and the extremely brief gag where Walsh shakes his head at The Duke to let him know he's not <em>really</em> going to shoot him brought the house down.

Shocking movie, honestly.<p>I was somewhat nonplussed by this in high school—"guys, they just drive out and drive back again," I remember saying, because I'm annoying—but now I've seen a lot more movies and it turns out that most movies aren't like this.<p>I forgot how <em>insanely</em> gruesome this is. In my head this was an "action movie" but it includes a pregnant woman who gets run over by a truck and the bad guys do a cesarean in the back of a land cruiser to pull out a stillborn baby. That's disgusting.<p>The dry brutality in the sand is beautifully contrasted with very sparse shoots of green, seen at the edges of frames; the lightning storm is so ferocious it's in black and white; the purple and blues warn of an unrestful evening. Utterly gorgeous film.<p>A full-throated feminist political statement in both theme and execution—and not the least bit self-referential about it. It just is. Ecosocialist propaganda, essentially.<p>Not only is it funny, it is exclusively funny in a bizarre Marx brothers way, where two people in absolutely bonkers costumes have a bickering back and forth about something wildly incongruous with their propensity for violence—like in a fantasy movie when two trolls get in an argument while the hero sets a trap. They have arguments staged in ways that make them look for all the world like they've Mario Kart characters.<p>One time the motorbikes dropped little bombs via BMX stunts.<p>The sound mixing pulling up the DOOF WARRIOR when the camera pans close and then going all out Javert-in-the-international-anniversary-version-of-Les-Mis guitar solo during his fight strokes the same primal nerve in me that the John Wick club scene does. They need to let me direct the Hotline Miami movie.<p>I read a New York Times oral history about the making of this movie and everyone involved talks like they did a tour of Afghanistan.

There's a painful self-examination at the core of this film that is actually obscured by how excellent a director Steven Spielberg is. He's great a directing scenes about how great a director he is, which should be totally insufferable but instead had me pumping my fist when he comes up with a trick to produce muzzle flashes. <p>There are long stretches with only a score for sound—mimicking the films that the protagonist is able to make with the technology available to him—which remind you that the person making <em>The Fabelmans</em> is in some ways not that far removed from Sammy Fabelman. This is especially devastating when the score is his mother's piano.<p>Paul Dano's performance really resonated with me.<p>An otherwise competent bildungsroman that does not lack for the occasional way-too-direct moment of dialog typical of the genre. It showcases the wound at the center of Steven Spielberg's work: films with ageless emotional cores which almost unfailingly insist that the deepest wrongs in this would can be addressed with a little courage, a little heart, or a little magic.<p>I'll always sign up to spend two hours believing with him.

When I first saw <em>Groundhog Day</em> I was amazed at how it only takes a shade of difference to take Bill Murray's comic persona, the lovable scamp, and make him a huge dick. It's basically the same guy!<p>I had the reverse experience with Paul Dano in this film. Dano tends to play characters who believe in something—fighter pilots, Jesus Christ, the cleansing power of riddles—with a deeply offputting fervor. And I started off feeling that way here, but then I started to believe with him. I believed in the dancing corpse and the bus in the woods and the acapella jurassic park theme and that anyone can rouse themselves back to life.<p>Okay, so the movie doesn't <em>quite</em> stick the landing or make the whole thing feel totally uncreepy but... I left happy. I'll take it.<p>Also Daniel Radcliff, Jesus Christ man.

I started out not really loving this but it won me over. <p>It's a little unfair because of who's playing them, but every scene with the two cops is hilarious. <p>I actually think everyone in this movie is very funny except for Jonah Hill, whose character is just a huge asshole the whole time. It kind of works better that way though, because it really sells what desperate losers these guys are. That makes the rest of the movie funnier and helps the sincerity land later.<p>Every high school friend group has a McLovin.

Pretty weird movie! It's a good paranoia thriller but not a good dystopia.<p>For starters, the wildly inconsistent setting that careens from normal looking rowhouse to flying car freeway to soviet bloc apartments, all ostensibly in the DC metro. I promise I'm not nitpicking, it's so jarring. There is essentially no worldbuilding except "You're in the future now! Kind of."<p>Precrime, the bad thing, is 100% accurate except in the case where one is aware of the vision. The movie takes an unambiguously anti-precime stance while demonstrating its total infallibility.<p>Colin Farrel's FBI character dies and no one ever says a word about it. Not that big a deal but I thought he was good in this movie and it would have been nice for all his screen time to amount to something.<p>All the <em>can you see</em> stuff doesn't add up either but it also engenders multiple excellent sight gags (haha) with some eyeballs so why not!<p>Fun movie, kept my attention.

A western.<p>There's some tremendously funny moments that come out of everyone's stubbornness. I cackled at the same time as the lone, awkward laugh in the pub, a sound gag that felt like it placed me in the room. Colm "playing" the violin by shaking it with his bloody stump...<p>It crushed me to watch Pádraic's doe-eyed incomprehension harden into desperation, then anger. "I just don't want ta be friends with ya no more" is a stone-cold premise you cannot reason with. There's a metaphor in the background about the civil war but I prefer this one literal: sometimes someone is just done with you. When I was younger I would have told you that this is just about the saddest thing I could imagine. Now I know that it's just a thing that happens—and that doesn't make it any less sad.

Look it's not a movie, it's a BazLurmie. If you don't know how to watch a BazLurmie then stay the heck away!!!<p>Cutting in the Doja Cat song—a massive hit in its own right—makes 50s Memphis feel alive to me. Lurhmann uses contemporary music in a very considered manner and I remain an unrepentant proponent of it. It's punchy! Black music gets some of the most electrifying screen time and the movie <em>really</em> meanders once it's gone. You could probably make the argument that it's structured this way to mirror Elvis losing touch with his roots and himself. I won't, but you could.<p>Austin Butler appears to have rewired his brain to play this role, which is a mildly upsetting but very funny outcome. It was worth it, he rocks here.<p>Tom Hanks as the Colonel adopts the figure and movement of a Russian nesting doll, if you gave a Russian nesting doll a cane and a quick peek inside the Ark of the Covenant. It is extraordinarily important that we never give Tom Hanks another Tom Hanks Role for the rest of his career. We already have those movies and they're great; let him wobble around as deranged PT Barnum now, he's having such a good time. <p>Unfocused, too long, questionable attachment to historical accuracy, and every time Elvis sings a song I start hootin and hollerin. <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> launched a million "named after a famous song" biopics and Baz doesn't go for any of that. This is ELVIS.

Mussolini stuff was a bit much. I am very into making fascists look silly but it felt tacked-on, especially since it was basically one of a few challenges for Pinocchio to overcome. This is obviously a recurring interest for del Toro but I thought the anti-fascist themes worked better as an explicit parallel to the protagonist's story (<i>Pan's Labrynth</i>) or as a thematic setting (<i>Shape of Water</i>).<p>Utterly gorgeous and charming though. I found it very moving—loved the morbid rabbits playing poker and the jokes about the morbid rabbits playing poker.

I feel like to hate this movie you have to take it seriously and I don't know how it's possible to take this movie seriously.

High-concept restaurants are the most harmless thing rich people do: you pay a ton of money and you leave hungry. It's like a joke they play on themselves. <p>Kind of hard to get onboard with a class warfare message where the workers are all signing up to self-s'more.<p>But all the lead actors are EATING in this one (except John Leguizamo, who seems kinda stoned).

I avoided this movie when it came out in middle school because I was already embarrassed be the kind of guy who might say "the cake is a lie" at a party—I didn't want to watch a kotakucore movie that would pretend this was something to be celebrated.<p><em>Scott Pilgrim</em> both is and isn't that movie. Edgar Wright is tremendously skilled at incorporating pop culture (and pop culture <i>sound) </i>into his films without reaching for the cheap thrill of recognition. A lesser director would have tossed a bunch of Super Mushrooms or something in the film and said "nerds will love that! let's pack it in." Instead you get gags like the enemies exploding into ever-increasing piles of coins, which is both wisely non-specific, and interacts with the physical set in increasingly silly ways. It's the least patronizing movie about gamers I've ever seen, which is a low bar but still, it's well done!<p>The other thing that now feels very prescient is that Scott is an asshole. The moral arc of the movie is Scott realizing that just because he's a weird loser does not mean he's better than the 7 exes that came before him. He's the 8th ex! From skimming the popular reviews on the movie left by women I guess a lot of men missed that. Not sure how—it opens with like 8 jokes about how Scott is dating a high schooler (??). Anyway: Gamergate, <em>Ready Player One</em>, etc etc etc. We're a wiser culture now, but Edgar Wright basically got it.<p>The thing with the brain chip was weird. It got about 10 seconds of screen time so maybe that was a holdover from the comic everyone was ashamed of. Can't win em all.<p>So no, Ramona Flowers is not real. You will not get a hot goth girl with blue hair and black boots by acting like Michael Cera, and also you can't act like Michael Cera because he's a movie star and you're not. But Julia Roberts is not going to wander into your apartment hiding from the paparazzi and Matthew McConaughey will not fall in love with you despite your best efforts to write a magazine piece about getting dumped in 10 days (haven't seen that one in a while). Movies are fake, but love is real, and it can happen to anyone even if they're still in the process of getting over themselves and growing up.<p>This movie is cute and funny, and I stayed up way later than I intended to finish it because I kept smiling. I'm glad I did not see it when I was 13.

I think it's kinda neat how Spielberg's animation style is so literal. You feel the presence of a "camera" wandering around a room like its a dollhouse. When he finally goes all out on "stunts" (the flashbacks and the final two fights) it feels like a boy's imagination come to life.<p>If I'm being honest with myself I was a tiny bit disappointed with this but perhaps that's because I was previously a boy visualizing these exact scenes. That boy enjoyed the movie with his little brother though.

First the good parts. Stephen Lang's marine was the character that I remembered most from the one time I watched this (which is exactly how many times everyone else saw this movie before we started all doing this weird gaslighting about its "cultural impact"), and going all-in on being a Ooh Rah Metal Gear Solid Villain actually sharpens the critique of America by revealing a seething libido underneath the limp spreadsheet. And everything after the bit where he jumps out of the big aircraft at the end kicks ass. Jim can do a high-stakes space fight in his sleep.<p>Obviously the visuals are amazing, and while they do kinda feel like graphics, the way fauna light up when you touch them is a guaranteed winner. The chemicals in my brain go crazy for that. Pandora is beautiful. It really is a treat to experience someone's vision for an imaginary place at this level of fidelity.<p>Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttt no, I'm sorry, I guarantee none of you will watch this a third time on purpose.<p>To use a superficially similar plot beat, when Killmonger burns the heart-shaped herb in <em>Black Panther</em>, the movie has already shown you two important things about it: a) it makes someone the Black Panther b) it provides a path to the ancestral plane, which links T'Challa (and Wakanda) to his ancestors. The stakes are so intuitive that in theaters I was briefly, genuinely outraged that he would burn a fictional plant. In this movie, Dr. Grace barely has time to explain something about the big tree having synapses before the marines light it up; I had also forgotten that there was a second, more important tree ready to go.<p>It's too obvious to dwell on but even <em>Dune</em>, a book written in 1965, has a more complicated view of the white savior.<p>For a guy who went on about hiring linguists to develop Na'vi grammar, Cameron does not actually seem to take the Na'vi seriously enough—nothing beyond "these guys are Native Americans." That felt corny to me when I was 12 and it has aged far worse than the visuals. And that's why still no one has anything to say about it.

Sharp, efficient, and subtle, slowing revealing a layered story first about Will Kane, then the town of Hadleyville, and finally how fragile the progress of American society really is and who will be willing to stand with you to defend what's right when the bandits arrive at high noon.<p>Hilarious, vicious visual joke at the end when the townspeople flood the square.

I didn't think this was good for two main reasons. The first, smaller, one is that it's either an action movie with no particularly impressive action sequences or a spy thriller with no particularly tense intrigue. Mission Impossible 1 does both of those things better.<p>My more important gripe is that Matt Damon is badly miscast as a Black Ops agent. Tom Cruise? Action hero. Daniel Craig? Action hero. But Matt Damon is not an action hero, he is a <i>rat</i>. He is a smart, sneaky little man who does what it takes to succeed in a world of Jude Laws, Matthew McConaugheys, Jeff Bridges, and Mark Whalbergs. Matt Damon doesn't kick ass, he survives. And God bless him.

There's a bunch of decent elements here: the <i>Metropolis</i>-inspired set design pairs well with the score to give Gotham a grim but cartoony feel; Nicholson can obviously play a total sicko and he doesn't sleepwalk through it; Keaton's perpetually baffled Bruce Wayne is endearing and believable.<p>But I'm sorry, watching this movie feels like the Donal Glover bit where everyone says they love old-school hip hop and then you go back and listen to it and it's all "well I went to the hat store today and I bought myself a hat."

One of the nicest people I knew in college lived a few doors down from me. His room had a TV and a soundbar and he got the idea to host "Miyazaki Movie Night." You'd show up at 8 or 9 and we'd do a big group order of Dominoes and that was a pretty great Tuesday evening as far as I was concerned. We quickly started watching other anime classics but having a guys-only anime movie night just sounded so painfully lame that we kept calling it Miyazaki Night regardless. When he graduated he passed the tradition on to me and my friend Andrew, which we did for a little while but ultimately didn't quite have the same juice.<p>This was my favorite movie that we watched. It has some flaws—Konakawa is sort in a plot of his own, the chairman is thinly sketched—but it's beautiful and freaky and when the score kicks I'm just full of gratitude that someone imagined this and made it real for me. To make a movie is to share your dreams with the world—a concept about which this movie is particularly self-aware.<p>I think if I could walk around as the manic pixie dream boy version of myself I would. But only in a dream.

A while ago my dad mentioned the famous line at the end. It's a very good line, especially because it's also the thesis of the film. You can hear it echo in every scene right up until it's actually said.<p>Clint Eastwood does a remarkable job balancing William Munny's history as a legendary killer and his present as a complete loser, which is essential to landing the film's message that these two states are a superposition, not a character arc. The reformed yeoman leaves his extremely young kids alone on a whim and can barely mount a horse. It is much cooler to hear the stories of a man who wasted the two (three?) cowboys holding him dead to rights than meet the man who could do such a thing.<p>The jail scene with the biographer, the sheriff, and the Englishman is a triumph of script and staging. It involves none of the movie's core trio and somehow tells you everything that you'll need to know about why they act the way they do when they're finally faced with the job they promised.<p>Whenever I see a shot of someone sitting on the stoop of a little ranch with a light dusting of snow, gazing at the mountains, I briefly feel the cold air in my lungs and hear the dull thud of my own footsteps. There is peace out there—but nothing to fill the emptiness that brought you.<p>Hell of a thing, killing a man.

The first thing you gotta know is that walking into this movie my friend looked up the 1972 comedy drama HEAT and told us the runtime was 90 minutes. So I spent most of the movie wildly disoriented. A top-tier way to experience this.<p>Right around the time the cops walk through the docks and realize they're the ones being surveilled, the movie catches up with what Pacino is putting down. Before that moment it's a sort of serious gangster film where serious guys give their wives serious looks, while Pacino's performance as a cop with underworld connections seems very out of place and unconvincing because Lt. Hanna is clearly insane. After the docks and the standout centerpiece in the diner, however, the movie a competition for who can be most coked up crazy man. And guess who's got a mile-long head start!<p>Totally excessive use of side characters, both in quantity and characterization. They introduce you to an obvious psycho in the first 10 minutes (he shoots someone for no reason, jeopardizing the heist). Later on, in case you've forgotten this man is a lunatic, they show him murdering a prostitute. Then the cops come and clarify that this is the 6th prostitute he's murdered. All this for a tertiary character who's essentially a plot device to trigger the third act.<p>"Shootout" wildly understates the amount of damage that three guys can do in downtown LA.<p>Way too long. Absolute blast.

If you asked me to guess what happens next at any point in this movie I would have been wrong. That can work in your favor as a director but it does require more skill to get the audience to buy in and I don't think Rian Johnson quite sticks the landing. Superb premise though!<p>JGL looks truly terrible in this movie. Like, distractingly bad. Not "I am from the gutter too" bad, "a four year-old did my eyebrows" bad. Apparently that stuff was supposed to make him look like a young Bruce Willis? It does not.<p>Inspired Jeff Daniels casting here, doing the Russian guy from JOHN WICK but he's Jeff Daniels and also I think this movie came out before JOHN WICK.

A perfect noir: cast a handsome, charismatic movie star as a gritty cop, and then make him a subtle but unmistakable loser. Imagine being in a test audience and seeing Harrison Ford wetly flop through the runtime of this movie. Your brain is just begging for him to ever be in control of the situation.<p>The Final Cut actually cuts back on some thematic subtlety while adding back a lot of narrative subtlety. It's more obvious that the replicants are the heroes and that Decker is an unreliable narrator, but there's no voiceover telling you that "skinjobs" means the n word. <p>I programmed this for movie night in college and picked the wrong version, so we all thought it was kind of bad. One of the few "alternate cuts" that makes a massive difference, so kudos to Ridley Scott for never letting it go. <p>I got to see it in theaters at IFC this summer. I would write a whole review about the visual impact of this film if I had the vocabulary for it.

My roommate a while back was watching Cobra Kai and I was struck by how much of the plot required you to have deep nostalgia for KARATE KID 3. Many ponderous shots of movie stills framed as photos and clip show flashbacks. It felt very unearned.<p>TOP GUN: MAVERICK is likewise reliant on emotional attachment to a movie from the 80s, but at least it's a better movie than the KARATE KID sequels. It's just a shame you don't really get to know any of the new pilots—even Rooster—because there isn't time to do anything but excavate the past. You could understand the lack of character development for Penny as an homage to the original TOP GUN though. <p>The non-flying parts work best if you read them an elegy for a different era of movie stars, which everyone (myself included) is clearly thirsty for; we just want movies made by someone who seems to care.<p>And Tom Cruise cares *so hard*. There is a pre-roll clip where he thanks you for seeing it in theaters and I thought that was great. This review makes me sound a little bit like a hater but I really enjoyed going to see it and I'm glad it exists and I hope more people follow its example. <p>The last 40 minutes are tremendous.

There's a great fakeout when Hunt attaches the helicopter cable to the train that's about to head into the tunnel and the camera does the quick back-and-forth that you'd see in any movie right before the villain crashes, but at the last second the helicopter pilot grins and dips the helicopter so he can fly it through the tunnel.

I have kind of a soft spot for the Doctor Strange movies, probably because I've seen them both in theaters and they're decently enjoyable as a no-thoughts-pretty-patterns experience. They just don't ask that much of me, and they return what I give!<p>It helps that Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the last people left in the MCU with genuine charisma. When DOCTOR STRANGE came out, Cumberbatch was on the tail end of a tumblr fandom typecasting that the movie was clearly happy to ride out. In 2022 we've seen a lot more of his range, and the MCU landscape has shifted sufficiently that the arrogance schtick is refreshingly retro. Xochitl Gomez seems like she's probably a good actress but if they're not going to let the next generation of stars have more personality than Tom Holland then I'm afraid we're in for a decade of incredible blandness.<p>Admittedly, a lot of the movie is bad. This is not a good environment for Rachel McAddams, who delivers the single least convincing one-liner I've  ever seen. It's so bad that it makes a pretty bad Cumberbatch one-liner minutes later seem electrifying by comparison. I understand that there are people who would be excited by the Patrick Stewart cameo even though I am not one of them; the legions of people who have apparently been fancasting John Krasinski as Reed Richards for a while live in a corner of our culture that I will simply never venture into.<p>Finally, Elizabeth Olson is great and the more that the movie leaned into the darkness of both its lead magicians the better it got. Having there be a "good guy" book that Strange fails to acquire before choosing use the dark magiks exceeded my low bar for MCU storytelling courage. And the zombie thing was cool as hell.

Video game NPC comes to life is an interesting idea. It somehow feels cliche even though I can't really think of any examples of it.

I think this is just under-appreciated enough to be a cult-classic? Not a single less-than-excellent performance from a stunning cast (did you remember that Cate Blanchett was in this?) and somehow Matt Damon still stands out, only two years after Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon is very good! Justice for Matt Damon.<p>The jazz bar scenes are electric and sexy. All the music is deployed very well, particularly the contrast between Dickie's charged saxophone and Tom's precise, melancholy piano. I read the novella in 12th Grade English and this is a masterclass in elevating the feel of a written source with sounds and colors and eye contact that only a movie can convey.<p>Half a point off because it's a bit too long and you *really* feel that in a movie this uncomfortable.

One of those beautiful little films that reminds you there's always a slightly new way to make a movie.

What really sets this apart, for me, was the emotional payoff to each goofy setup—especially when you thought they'd already gotten the most mileage they could out of each joke. Each universe is its own little note of appreciation for the way movies manipulate your emotions, and the various cliches we're familiar with but still charmed by. The two rocks is the most heart-wrenching example and I thought the Chungking Express-style tribute was powerful as well. My friend Spencer lost it every time the racoon was onscreen. Wonderful movie.

Some lovely directorial moves in key scenes. I particularly liked how the film presents the breakup in discrete scenes with no transitions; demarcating the stages of the fight but also letting them flow into each other. The time stop sequence—from the film's promotional photo, though you wouldn't know it—is a gorgeous centerpiece to a story about being unable to decide if things are moving too fast or two slow. I do not share this woman's angst (I have other, different issues with earlyish adulthood!) but I did leave feeling like I understood them.

I want to reclaim this film so badly. I want to tell you that we were all wrong when it came out and it's secretly the most brilliant of the Nolan Batman movies. I just can't do it. It's every bit as incoherent politically as THE DARK KNIGHT, but even though Bane is a worthy follow-up to The Joker (you know it's true), RISES lacks its predecessor's underappreciated endogenous villain: Harvey Dent, the home-grown embodiment of Gotham's flaws.<p>RISES adds up to less than the sum of its parts, but there's something special about how iconic some of these parts are. In addition to his legendarily silly voice, Tom Hardy's Bane speaks entirely in semicolons. Every single line is a setup for an immediately-delivered punchline. "You merely adopted the dark; I was born in it!" but you probably forgot about "Now is not the time for fear, doctor; that comes later!" "We both know I have to kill you; you'll simply have to imagine the flames" is less quotable out of context but hilarious and "Follow him; *gunshot*" is a particularly clever use of the script beat as semicolon.<p>Anne Hathaway is not believable as a poor person but terrific as Catwoman. The complete arc of Cillian Murphy's character is uncharacteristically subtle for Nolan and he somehow sneaks in one of the movie's best lines. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a lot of earnesting and accomplishes essentially nothing. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine anchor the franchise. And hey; it's Batman baby.

The Thomas Wayne Problem: hard to depict a "good billionaire" these days, hard to make Batman's dad bad. I'm not sure if Batman is an inherently political superhero or if the concept of a city has become so politicized that it feels impossible to depict Gotham without focusing on the political. THE BATMAN juxtaposes familiar contemporary images (the young reformer politician, a handful of militarized incels) against the more traditional turn of the century gothic ones (Colin Farrel's Penguin cutting an entirely different tone than the rest of the cast); in my opinion, the latter are better realized.<p>Robert Pattinson and Paul Dano are very good when their masks are off. I really wanted it to be even more noir—let's see Batman light a match and burn it down to his fingertips just to feel something. I love club fights! Bit of shame how little Paul Dano gets to be onscreen without the gimp mask, but maybe that heightens the impact at the end a little more. Who's to say. It's Batman baby.

Nobody ever talks about how hilarious the hallucinogenic special effect is. Scarecrow's superpower makes Batman look like he's in one of those "realistic" SpongeBob cutaways. The blurry glowing horse eyes look like they came from an After Effects YouTube tutorial. They serve the crucial purpose of reminding you that you're watching a comic book movie.<p>BATMAN BEGINS portends an industry that would burn comic IP to a crisp in a vain attempt to replicate the magic of its successor, but BATMAN BEGINS is a really fun superhero movie. It's campy and silly and "serious" only to the extent that you're willing to take it seriously, which the film itself in no way insists that you do. Chris Nolan has some very obvious blind spots—he goes to ridiculous lengths to make you think Thomas Wayne was one of the "good" billionaires—but I really doubt he expects you to take a coherent message from this movie. Bruce Wayne says something like "I can have a greater impact as a symbol than a man" and everyone else is like "uh I guess." Then he dresses up like a bat and fights street crime in a tank.<p>Anyway everyone here has a great time and I learned that my girlfriend thinks Cillian Murphy is really hot, an appeal I understand and to some degree believe I can replicate.

Michael Bay was sort of a punchline growing up—explosions, cars, Megan Fox—but watching this made his whole style click for me. It's like that Yoshi's Island or Mario Party minigame where you have to blow up the balloon as big as you can without making it pop, only you don't know exactly how much it can stretch. Oh, you think it can't get sillier than a cartoonishly Russian Cosmonaut saving Ben Affleck's character from an exploding ISS? What if they were in a Space Hummer offroading The Moon? What I'm saying is filmmaking is the art of blowing up a balloon, and Michael Bay's breath is Pure Silliness; in Armageddon, that balloon keeps getting bigger, but it does not pop.

It's fun, it's good, I recommend that you watch it, but ultimately I wanted to like it slightly more than I did.<p>The aliens are criminally uninteresting, both visually and philosophically. A very good genre story makes you feel like creator had a coherent idea for who or what the aliens are; this feels like the director said "go make me some aliens that look like they could hurt you" and then didn't talk to the VFX department again. <p>The GROUNDHOG DAY bits are done really well though. The movie plays with your expectations about how many times Cage has been at a particular location in ways that are pleasantly predictable, and Cruise plays his character arc with the appropriate amount of sincerity.<p>In summary: they gave Emily Blunt a Final Fantasy sword.

A real Western's Western by the two modern filmmakers who best understand what the genre is for. Casting Matt Damon alongside Jeff Bridges is a particularly inspired choice. The moment you meet Cogburn you instantly understand the role he inhabits in this society (such as it is) and can precisely trace the arc of his relationship with the film's young heroine, while Matt Damon has, as they say, "a face that knows about texting." The Coens use your biases—and a string of terrific one liners from the far more charismatic star shitting on him—to make what should be a predictable character arc feel like a pleasant surprise. This version of TRUE GRIT is unmistakably a film made in 2010, with a soul much older.<p>The Coen Brothers have directed more than one perfect movie. While this is not one of them, the wide shots, the campfires, and the first notes of Mattie's theme made me long to be somewhere else—to be someone else—in a way that only the best movies can.

A few of these long, loosely connected scenes are some of the best filmmaking I've ever seen and ever will see. The opening act is such a force of pacing and performance that you want to say it could be a one-act play, except it couldn't, because you need to move around the room with the camera, in and out and around, to be disoriented as much by the perspective as by the utterly insane tone in which Christopher Waltz is speaking. I'll probably appreciate it more the second time I see it, but I also can't shake the feeling that this movie shouldn't exist.

I love the fun that Wes Anderson has with framing devices. Each vignette feels like it was written by a slightly different writer, and the plots have a distinctly magazine story-like cadence to them: each with a little ah ha! moment and then a tidy, slightly wistful resolution. Francis McDormand sadly wasted in the worst segment and Bill Murray seems to be begging us to just let him rest but everyone else has a jolly good time telling jolly good stories. A lovely evening at the pictures.

I remember seeing this trailer in theaters and thinking it looked pretty sweet. Then I listened to the haters and never saw it. The haters were wrong.<p>I read and loved the book so it's hard for me to separate from that, but I thought the movie articulated the book's themes in a really thoughtful way that drew from the source material but highlighted different aspects of it.

More movies should have sequels in wildly different genres. Regularly dispatching Xenomorph armies with machine gun fire does obviously diminish the threat of the "perfect organism" somewhat, but the tone swap also allows the movie to comment on the original in subtle ways. More people live, anti-robot prejudice is overcome, workers remain disposable to capital, and Ripley has opportunities not just for revenge, but for renewal. ALIENS is a mildly jarring sequel to ALIEN, but a worthwhile one.<p>As a standalone action movie... I've never seen anything that's simultaneously hilarious and terrifying like the way the Queen pushes the "Up" button on the elevator. I could write a dissertation about it.

My favorite part about this musical is how all the lyrics are simplified to the point of parody. The first song "So May We Start" asks if you're ready to start the movie. Henry and Ann share how much they love each other in the song "We Love Each Other So Much." Henry refers to their conductor friend exclusively as "conductor friend." All the artifice in the dialogue is boiled away so the melodrama has to be built out of the staging, the acting, and the music. <p>Gotta have a high tolerance for Weird with this one. See it in theaters if you can; it's funny in that way that's magnified by being part of an audience that's every bit as uncomfortable as you.

I understand that "why would you just volunteer to go get beheaded" is the point of the story, but understanding that it's the point doesn't make it any less alienating. It's just sort of un-resolvable. This version offers some hints about manhood or purpose or God that you're welcome to take it up on, but the premise is such a black hole that you're never going to be really satisfied. You can fill it with the ennui of your choice. <p>I left this movie feeling very weird but now I've decided I liked it a lot. I do wish it had been a bit less Midsommar-y. The direction creates tension in a lot of interesting ways that I think draw a little better from the source material, especially the green growth/decay dichotomy. Not every a24 movie has to have weird strings.

You really gotta see this one twice. I saw this four years ago and I was so rattled by the ending that it's pretty much all I remembered. When my friends suggested we go see it at a local theater, I basically did it to see them all get rattled too. But I actually really liked it the second time! The brighter notes of the film come through a lot stronger on the rewatch—Kaneda seems more lighthearted, the Numbers more sympathetic, the ending more optimistic.

I watched this when it came out in theaters and since then I’ve wondered whether this movie was really that great or if I just have fond memories of it because I saw it with my high school girlfriend during the three months where that relationship actually worked. If you, too, are struggling to disentangle this film from brambles of nostalgia, then I have some terrific news—GODZILLA absolutely whips.<p>There are two big things that this movie does right, and they’re both sort of the same thing. The first is that the monsters are utterly enormous. Most of the time you only see limbs, which is way more effective than it could have been. They’re so goddamn big that it does not feel remotely plausible that the humans could affect their battle, which is the second thing. The film really commits to a lot of the core Godzilla mythos (I came out of the sea because you need to STOP) which gives the whole film a lot more humility than you normally see in a blockbuster.<p>Until the Atomic Breath, which is totally rad. *screeeeeeeeeeee*

This is a hard one to watch. Very bleak. Carey Mulligan is <i>outstanding</i>; there are a few moments when she snaps into a wildly different emotion with a precision that should feel disorienting but instead feels earned. Laverne Cox and Jennifer Coolidge both deliver thoughtful, understated performances that fill out Cassie’s life with people who care about her, even though Cassie is unable to process that anymore. Bo Burnham perfectly understands the line he’s supposed to walk. I agree with a lot of the criticisms of the ending but I also understand what I think is the film’s perspective that there is no “right” way way to deal with that trauma—no one should have had to experience it in the first place.

One thing we really lost when people my age stopped getting cable is the experience of having John Wick 2 come on right after John Wick. It's important that I didn't have to make a choice to watch John Wick 2; it just happened and I accepted it. The only thing that kept me from watching John Wick 3 immediately after is that SyFy didn't have the guts to go all in on the triple feature.<p>I think it's slightly less good than the first one but I think they're both 4 stars?

I'm such a titanic sucker for the music in this movie. This is the kind of shit I'd listen to when walking back home alone from a bar in Seattle. Hardcore loner moves that look super classy on Ryan Gosling and somewhat less classy on me.

This is a perfect movie. <p>SPEED is as complicated or as simple as you want it to be. If you like, you can talk about the flawless pacing, how little challenges are layered on top of the premise so that you feel the immediacy of getting the injured driver off the bus or finding a route on the highway without forgetting the underlying peril. You can focus on the carefully paced comic relief, which catches you off-guard and yet still feels like something that particular, random bus passenger would have said in a stressful situation. You can note how Sandra Bullock's exceedingly charming affect slowly peels away to reveal pure terror as her character finally uses up her last reserves of courage.<p>OR! You can empty your head and enjoy this unbelievably rad movie about people trapped on a city bus that will explode if it goes below 50 miles per hour.

My dad said it was a "tortuous snoozefest" and then spent the next 10 minutes talking about how terrific the acting, writing, and various poignant moments in the film were.

When I was a little kid occasionally one of my parents' friends would take the time to humor me and act really interested in what I had to say. I would go on and on explaining something I was super into at the time and I never once questioned whether the full grown adult conversing with me was genuinely invested in it. When I'm the adult I'll probably find myself faking it a fair amount, but I hope that I retain enough of the little kid that when someone wants to tell me about something important to them, I'm always available to listen.<p>All of which is to say I found the scene where Henry Clayton talks to Alfred confusing at first and then very moving in retrospect.

When the trailer for this came out I was in the middle of Atlanta Season 2 and thrilled to watch Lakeith Stanfield do basically anything so I got all my roommates to go out with me on a weekday night to see it but when we got there I realized I had gotten the date on the ticket wrong and the movie wasn't out until tomorrow. We watched Ant-Man and The Wasp (2018) instead. Then, like most things I try once that don't work out, I was completely de-motivated and it left theaters.<p>This movie is the opposite of Ant-Man and The Wasp, except for one very jarring similarity that will become apparent towards the end.

A complicated, well-told story about labor, capital, and culture that also includes a scene where Ohioan factory workers go to China for the company party and do the YMCA in front of a giant LCD screen of Minions.

Tenet is what Inception-haters think Inception is. I'd still watch it again though.

Good watch if you don't know anything about Theranos (I didn't) and don't feel like reading. The production is so creepy it's sometimes hard to figure out whether her affect is as unnerving as the visuals and the score make her out to be. That voice is something else though.

This is a very good movie that ably executes on the tropes of the American Tycoon—titanic ambition! shocking cruelty! long shots of undeveloped land!—and I enjoyed watching the film lumber toward its grim conclusion. But outside than the momentary catharsis in the baptism scene ("I've abandoned my boy!") it lacks the spark of humanity that elevates other, even darker, films of the same genre to greatness.

Jon Stewart's hatred for the political-industrial complex has aged better than you might think—he has a clearer vision of the centrifugal forces pulling this country apart than his many imitators have been able to articulate since he left the air. He should have actually made the movie about that.

Inception spends a lot of time explaining its dreams. Especially in contrast with Paprika, the Satoshi Kon anime that inspired it, Inception's dreamscapes have a famously rigid quality: the business-formal attire, the precise chronology of the dream layers. But that's fine, because Inception isn't really about dreams. It's about memories.<p>The beating heart of Inception is a simple idea—that the thing we dream for is the chance to change a painful memory. The scenery is limited because the dreamers themselves are limited; they're trapped, in the words of the film's most underrated motif, as "old men, filled with regret, waiting to die alone."<p>What elevates Inception above its bro-philosophy puzzle-box contemporaries is that it delivers on the emotional catharsis it promises. A tweak to Fischer's memory provides the closure his neglectful father couldn't at the same moment that Cobb relinquishes the vengeful memory of his dead wife at the same moment that lots of things explode.<p>Inception was a cultural monolith when it was released and it remains a monolith, if a diminished one. And though this gets slightly more embarrassing to admit with age, it remains my favorite movie as well.
