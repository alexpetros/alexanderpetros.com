<title>Why HTMX Doesn't Have a Build Step</title>

<h1>Why HTMX Doesn't Have a Build Step</h1>

<p>A recurring question from some htmx contributors—and prospective
contributes—is why htmx isn’t written in TypeScript. Or, for that
matter, why htmx lacks any build step, modularization, or even static
code checking. The full htmx source is a single 3,500-line
<code>.js</code> file—if you want to contribute to htmx, you do so by
modifying the that file, the same file that gets sent to
browsers in production, give or take minification and compression.</p>

<p>I do not speak for the htmx project, but I have made a few nontrivial
contributions to it, and have been a vocal advocate for retaining this
no-build setup every time the issue has arisen. From my perspective,
here’s why htmx does not have a build step.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<h3 id="write-once-run-forever">write once, run forever</h3>

<p>The best reason to write plain JavaScript is that it lasts forever.
This is, in my opinion, JavaScript’s single most underrated feature.
While I’m sure there are some corner cases, JavaScript from 1999 that
ran in Netscape Navigator will run unaltered, alongside modern code, in
Google Chrome downloaded yesterday. That is true for very few
programming environments. It’s certainly not true for Python, or Java,
or C, which all have versioning mechanisms where opting for new language
features will force you off of deprecated APIs.</p>

<p>Of course, most people’s experience with JavaScript is that is ages
like than milk. Reopen a node repository after 3 months and you’ll find
that your project is mired in a flurry of security warnings,
backwards-incompatible library “upgrades,” and a frontend framework
whose cultural peak was the exact moment you started the project and is
now widely considered tech debt. Who’s to blame for this situation is
for someone else to decide, but the fact is incontrovertible that this
problem is removed if you use no dependencies whatsoever (other than the
JavaScript runtime). And compilers are a dependency.</p>

<p>A popular way to write write JavaScript today is compile it from
TypeScript (which I will use frequently as an example, because
TypeScript is probably the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning">best
reason</a> to use a build system). TypeScript does not run natively in
web browsers, so TypeScript code is not protected by ECMA’s fanatical
devotion to backwards compatibility. Like any dependency, new major
versions are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible with the previous
ones. They might be! But if they aren’t, then you need to do maintenance
if you want to use the modern development toolchain.</p>

<p>Maintenance is a cost paid for with labor, and open-source projects
are the ones that can least afford to pay it. Opting not to use a build
step drastically minimizes the labor required to keep htmx up-to-date.
This experience has been borne out by intercooler.js, the predecessor to
htmx from the same author which is actively maintained with (as I
understand) very little effort. When htmx 1.0 was released, TypeScript
was at version 4.1; when intercooler.js was released, TypeScript was
pre-1.0. Would code written in those TypeScript versions compile
unmodified in today’s TypeScript compiler (version 5.1 at the time of
writing)? Maybe, maybe not.</p>

<p>But htmx is written in JavaScript, with no dependencies, so it will run
unmodified for as long as web browsers remain relevant. Let the browser
vendors do the hard work for you.</p>

<h3 id="developer-experience">developer experience</h3>

<p>It is true that the TypeScript developer experience (DX) is better
than the JavaScript developer experience in some respects. TypeScript
has… types, which make your IDE better at suggesting code and pointing
out where you might have used methods incorrectly. The tools for
automatically renaming, refactoring, and generally munging your code are
much more reliable for TypeScript than they are for JavaScript. For this
reason, TypeScript is a very popular way to write code for JavaScript
runtimes.</p>

<p>It is not true that the TypeScript DX is better in <em>every</em>

respect, and the tendency of software engineers to view progress as a
teleology of capability rather than a set of tradeoffs sometimes blinds
them to the cost paid for the DX aspects they like. For instance, a
small tradeoff you make for using TypeScript is that compiling it takes
time, and you have to wait for it to recompile to test a change. Usually
this cost is negligible, and well worth paying, but it is nonetheless a
cost.</p>

<p>A more significant cost for using TypeScript is that the code running
in the browser is not the code you wrote, which makes all the browser’s
tools harder to use. If your code throws an exception, you have to
figure out how the stack trace (with its JavaScript line numbers,
JavaScript function signatures, and so forth) maps to the TypeScript
code that you wrote; if you write JavaScript, you can click straight
through to the source code, read the thing you wrote, and set a
breakpoint in the debugger. This is <em>tremendous</em> DX. It lowers to
barrier to using all the incredibly powerful debugging tools that are
built into browser. For a lot of younger web developers who have never
worked this way, it is a revelatory experience.</p>

<p>Build step advocates point out that TypeScript can generate <a
href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/debugger/how_to/use_a_source_map/index.html">source
maps</a>, which tell your browser what TypeScript corresponds to what
JavaScript, and that’s true! But now you have <em>another</em> thing to
keep track of—the TypeScript you wrote, the JavaScript it generated, and
the source map that connects these two. The hot-reloading development
server you’re now dependent on will keep these up to date for you in
development mode, and make sure you browser is aware of them—but what
about on your staging server? What about in production? Bugs that appear
in these environments will be harder to track down, because you’ve lost
a lot of information about where they come from. These are solvable
problems, but they’re problems you created; they are a cost.</p>

<p>The htmx DX is very simple—your browser loads a single file, which in
every environment is the exact same file you wrote. The tradeoffs
required to maintain that experience are real, but they’re tradeoffs
that make sense for this project.</p>

<h3 id="enforced-clarity">enforced clarity</h3>

<p>Modularization is one of the <a
href="https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">honking great
ideas</a> of software. Modules make it possible to solve incredibly
complex problems by breaking down code into well-contained substructures
that solve smaller problems. Modules are really useful.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you want to solve simple problems, or at least
relatively simple problems. In those cases, it can be helpful
<em>not</em> to use the building blocks of more complex software, lest
you rebuild their complexity without creating comensurate value. At its
core, htmx solves a relatively simple problem: we’re adding a handful of
attributes to HTML that make it easier to replace DOM elements using the
declarative character of hypertext. Requiring that all the htmx code
remain in a single file (again, around 3,500 lines of code) enforces a
degree of intention on the library; there is a real pressure when
working on the htmx source to justify the addition new lines of code, a
pressure which enforces a degree of simplicity.</p>

<p>While the DX tradeoffs are obvious, there are also surprising DX
benefits. If you search a function name in the source file, you’ll
instantly find all the uses of that function (this also mitigates the
need for more-advanced code introspection). The lack of places for
functionality to hide makes working on htmx a lot more approachable.
Far, far more complex projects use aspects of this approach as well:
SQLite3 compiles from a <a
href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">single-file source
amalgamation</a> (though they use separate files for development,
they’re not <em>crazy</em>) which makes hacking on it <a
href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/28/sqlite-is-really-easy-to-compile/">significantly
easier</a>. You could never build the linux kernel this way—but we’re
not building the linux kernel.</p>

<h1 id="costs">Costs</h1>

<h3 id="no-static-types">No static types</h3>

<p><a href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-type-systems">The htmx
project is not anti-static typing!</a> It does have to be written in
JavaScript, though, because browsers run JavaScript. And <a
href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations">as long as
JavaScript is dynamically typed</a>, the tradeoffs required to get true
static typing in the htmx source (htmx <em>users</em> can of course take
advantage of the types we declare with <code>.d.ts</code> files) are not
worth it.</p>

<p>We are exploring the possibility of using JSDoc to get some of the
same guarantees without the build step. Other libraries, like <a
href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/8569">Svelte</a>, have
been trending in this direction as well, in part due to the <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35892250">debugging
friction</a> that TypeScript files introduce.</p>

<h3 id="no-es6">No ES6</h3>

<p>We maintain support for Internet Explorer 11, and because we do not
have a build step, every line of htmx has to be written in
IE11-compatible JavaScript, which means no ES6. When people like me say
that JavaScript is pretty good now, they are usually referring to
language features like <code>async/await</code>, anonymous functions,
and functional array methods (i.e. <code>.map</code>,
<code>.forEach</code>) that were introduced with ES6—none of which can
be used in the htmx source.</p>

<p>While this is incredibly annoying, from a practical standpoint, it’s
not a huge impediment for development. The lack of some nice language
features doesn’t prevent us from writing code with functional paradigms.
Would it be nice not to write our own <a
href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/b4a61c543b283eb2315a47708006783efb78f563/src/htmx.js#L375-L381">forEach
method</a>? Of course. But until all the browsers we target support ES6,
we can make do by supplementing ES5 with a few helper functions. If you
are used to ES6, you will automatically write better ES5.</p>

<p>IE11 support is going to be dropped in htmx 2.0, and we’ll be able to
use ES6 for development.</p>

<h3 id="no-modules-in-core">No modules in core</h3>

<p>This point is obvious, but it’s worth re-stating: the htmx source
would be a lot tidier if we could split it into modules. <a
href="https://www.steveonstuff.com/2022/01/27/no-such-thing-as-clean-code">There
are other factors that go into code quality besides tidiness</a>, but to
the extent that the htmx source is high-quality, it is not because it is
tidy.</p>

<p>This some things we want to do with htmx very difficult. The <a
href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph">idiomorph
algorithm</a> is going to included in the htmx 2.0 core, but we’d like
to be able to maintain it as a separate package so that people can use
the DOM-morphing algorithm without using htmx. If the core could include
multiple files, we could easily do with any number of mirroring schemes,
such as git submodules. But we cannot, because the core is a single
file, so the idiomorph code will have to live there as well. That’s a
problem we created for ourselves too.</p>
